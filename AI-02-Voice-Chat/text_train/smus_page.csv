     I will admit it: all throughout my schooling I thought I hated group work. Over the last few decades, I have now come to realize that I did not actually hate collaboration, I just was never taught how to work in a group. As a young adult, I did not intuitively have the skills to manage group work. Lacking the skills or language to collaborate effectively, I used some of my dominant personality traits, such as placing a high value on efficiency, and usually ended up doing most of the group work myself, all the while feeling an unproductive sense of martyrdom and resentment. In my mid-20s, I volunteered to help a friend, who was learning to facilitate workshops that helped people figure out their personality types. It was in this workshop that I started to identify the strengths of different personality types and learn the skills of effective group work. I also realized that what I saw as a personal strength – being highly efficient – also had the far less attractive shadow characteristic of being bossy and non-inclusive. Since this time I have been slowly and surely improving my collaboration skills and I purposely seek out the skills of diverse thinkers when I need to solve a problem. Thankfully, SMUS students do not have to wait until their mid-20s to begin to learn the important skill of collaboration. Collaboration, which is both a trait of our Portrait of a Learner and a key Ministry of Education core competency, encompasses a set of skills that are explicitly taught and nurtured at our school, both in classes and through community time like chapel. And though it is not always pretty or easy, our students are consistently being given the opportunity to practise and develop these skills. This year, on the Middle School final report card each student will write a reflection on their skills as a collaborator. At each grade level, students have been taught collaborative skills, assessed themselves against these skills and then practiced the skills on current curricular projects such as the Grade 6 Sustainable School Redesign, the Grade 7 world religions project and the Grade 7/8 standing white board math problem solving. The collaboration is not always without its pain points, and due to this year’s cohort system our students are spending a lot more time with the same people, which sometimes results in group friction. Despite the sometimes messy nature of having adolescents work together, there has definitely been an increased awareness of what good collaboration looks and sounds like, and a lot of examples of positive collaboration. Just last week, I observed a Grade 6 class that was in the process of giving feedback to each other on their collaboration skills. The students were generous in their praise of each other’s positive group work traits but the discussion got really interesting as they tried to respectfully state what was not going well. As teachers, we had to push students to be honest but once they got the hang of it, they seemed empowered to get what were perhaps some simmering resentments out in the open. I heard and read statements such as, “I wish you would share your ideas more instead of being distracted” or “Sometimes it seems like you think your ideas are better than mine and you only write down your ideas when it is supposed to be all of our ideas.” Or my favourite exchange, when one student asked what it meant to diplomatically disagree and another student answered by saying, “It’s when instead of saying ‘that’s stupid’ you say ‘can you tell me more?’.” I sure could have used that type of language during my university days. Nurturing the development of students who have the ability to respectfully collaborate and communicate with people of diverse backgrounds and opinions is a laudable goal. Though our students, like my younger self, may complain at the dinner table about some unsatisfactory collaboration that occurred that day, rest assured that they are being skillfully guided by their teachers to navigate these sometimes uncomfortable situations and are gaining the skills necessary for learning, leading, and serving in this complex global world.

     With our Kindergarten Virtual Open House taking place on March 16, Sarah Lund, Admissions Associate at the Junior School, reflects on the ways in which our Kindergarten students use their environment as a learning tool. At SMUS, we truly believe our students to be highly capable learners. Our Kindergarten students demonstrate this daily within the walls of the Junior School, and they also take this ethic into the great outdoors where they show curiosity and a sense of wonder about the local environment and their place in the world. Every Friday morning, the Kindergarten classes venture together on their outdoor learning excursion led by outdoor education specialist Mr. Jamie Pope. The Kindergarten children demonstrate great resilience – venturing out to experience learning in all weather conditions. Most recently they walked all the way to Kitty Islet and previously, Anderson Hill. Each of those two destinations is an almost three-kilometre round trip! We are so fortunate to have a wonderful parent community with moms, dads and grandparents able to join us on our outings. They witness firsthand this natural curiosity and inquisitiveness which are nurtured in this unique and beautiful environment. These weekly adventures encourage students’ curiosity and inquiry in a natural environment and promote active participation building on their many observations and interests. On these walks they are able to experience the accessible beauty offered by our surrounding beaches and parks and better understand the natural world. As researchers of their world, the Kindergarten students embody the spirit of scientists, asking questions, making exploratory observations, using their senses and growing their knowledge. Stewardship, geology, tidal life, Indigenous and First Peoples knowledge, and plants and animals are just a few of the many topics our Kindergarten children wonder about. When reflecting on these excursions, Kindergarten student Devon says, “I learn so many things when I go on beach walks. It’s important to know about nature because that’s where animals live. My teachers help me learn – like making tents.” “I like learning about undersea creatures with Mr. Pope. We made fun creatures with bull kelp!” added Zara. “It's a type of seaweed that is yellow. I took a close look at it with a magnifying glass.“ These engaging visits into nature are brought back to the classroom and used to extend and deepen learning. Inspired by a recent visit to the beach, the students used loose part materials to recreate tidal scene mosaics, which they now proudly display. Each Kindergarten class creates a weekly newsletter to encapsulate the activities and make learning visible. You can find a sample of our Kindergarten Weekly newsletters in the gallery below. These wonderful Kindergarten Weekly letters are a precious memory of the rich and varied activities which encourage the students’ natural curiosity and inquisitiveness in a natural learning environment that encourage active participation. Kindergarten students at SMUS have enhanced and engaging offerings, and Friday expeditions certainly end their week in a very fulfilling way.

     Parents and guardians play a pivotal role in their child's education, and their involvement as partners is crucial for fostering a supportive and enriching learning environment. We understand that collaboration between parents and educators is beneficial in promoting student success, nurturing a holistic approach and creating a positive school culture. From Junior Kindergarten all the way to Grade 12 at SMUS, we want you to be involved in your child’s education. We all share common goals for the children of happiness, growth, and preparation for life. When thinking about the partnership between home and school, ongoing and open communication is imperative. We always ask parents to share valuable insights into their child’s strengths, areas of growth, interests and passions as we work together to support the whole child. At the Junior School, we invite supportive adults to be involved with their child’s learning in many ways. Our goal is to provide parents with insight into our program to help support the learning, academically, socially and emotionally. We begin the year with opportunities to connect as a community, with the parent information night, family BBQ and coffee mornings which help to establish relationships that will be fostered during the current school year and for years to come. During the remainder of the year, we communicate through parent-teacher conferences, formal and informal reports, student-led conferences and grade celebrations of learning. Google Classroom is also a wonderful way for parents to feel connected, and up to date with what is happening at school academically. Parents/guardians are their children’s first teacher and serve as an essential link between the school and home environment. By fostering a culture of learning at home, parents reinforce what is being taught in the classroom and provide enriching experiences beyond school hours. Encouraging regular reading, discussing school work, and engaging in creative, playful activities help children develop a love for learning and enhance their natural curiosity. Many parents will ask “how much do I help with homework?” Parents/guardians can be supportive, encouraging and offer guidance when needed. Asking questions that encourage critical thinking and problem solving are also beneficial. Hints are good, but parents/guardians should avoid over-helping and remember that time management is a skill that needs to be developed with children. Helping by removing distractions, breaking tasks down into manageable pieces and setting a timer, are helpful. Parent involvement in the learning allows students to feel supported and confident in their abilities. SMUS is a special place where the community works together to ensure we are an amazing place to play and learn. The parent/guardian involvement goes far beyond just supporting their own children, but is also supporting the community as a whole. The Junior School recently held an appreciation assembly where we spoke about the importance of service, and honoured our parent/guardian volunteers. SMUS has a strong Parents’ Auxiliary committee, and volunteers at the Junior School help with hot lunches, library, iLab, the musical, and outdoor education. We also have Welcome committees, used uniform sales, buddy families, class representatives and guest speakers. The list goes on. Parents/guardians contribute their skills and talents in so many ways and help to create a vibrant school community. We thank all the parents/guardians in our community who continue to prove that they are invaluable partners as they work alongside us to create a supportive and enriching educational experience for children.

     As we look back on a busy and exciting year, we’re sad to say goodbye but proud to have made an impact on a school that’s given us so much opportunity. When reflecting on some of our achievements, a few events come to mind. The Christmas assembly was a welcome return to the annual roster of school wide gatherings. Filled with theatrics, costume, and song, students from K-12 smiled wide watching Santa and his festive elf partner search the gym for their lost team of reindeer-dressed prefects. Greeting wide-eyed Junior School students in Santa gear after the assembly was a full circle moment for the two of us, having both been in the Junior School ourselves. Along with re-establishing old traditions, we were pleased to rebrand a newer one: spirit week. This fun-filled week of games, snacks, and ditching the uniform was a great way to wrap up a particularly exciting year. With our enthusiastic and ambitious prefect team, we created theme days such as “Tropical Tuesday” and “Western Wednesday”, where all students grade 9-12 were invited to dress up in casual clothes and join in on the fun and games during lunchtime and recess. Of course, there are many people worth mentioning who have made our time as head prefects both easier and exceptionally more enjoyable. Notably, our predecessors Devon and Jonathan, Mr. Primrose, Mr. Anderson, and of course the student prefect team who worked tirelessly behind the scenes on projects and initiatives. All have been incredibly helpful, inspirational, and reliable. It’s been a tremendous honour to have been this year's head prefects and we hope to stay in contact with the vibrant SMUS community as we watch the next generation of leaders flourish. To conclude our final message, we’d like to share a poem that we wrote to be published in the yearbook, which we think sums up this truly unique and remarkable year: The year has passed and rather fast we throw our caps and bears 
We’ll dress for grad and all be glad to leave behind our cares But just before we’re out the door let's think about the past
So take a look through this yearbook for mem’ries sure to last We started in September where the nerves were running high
We welcomed lots of boarders from Toronto to Shanghai On Halloween we set the scene with scary ghosts and ghouls 
‘Til Christmas day when Santa's sleigh brought joy to all three schools We won a double banner thanks to senior sporting girls
And set the stage for all the rage of Jewish musicals We’ll miss the Howard cookies and the large assemblies 
The clubs and plays will always stay inside our memories And to the teachers many thanks for giving us support 
You’ve led us to our passions be they music art or sport We’ll finish with some wisdom from your proper prefect pals
So read through twice this free advice from Ryan K and Tal So to the nines I hope you find you’ve passed your foremost test 
Now face your fears the next three years will surely be the best For tenth grade class it’s time to pass the halfway point at school
Before you know you’ll have to go and live by your own rule To next year's grads I hope you’ve had a happy year at SMUS
You’re almost done so have some fun there’s so much left to do And to the twelves it’s time we delve to university 
We’re loud and free and proud to be the class of twenty-three

     Yesterday, members of the SMUS community witnessed history in the making as we joined our esteemed Indigenous community of elders and artists, along with their families, to be a part of the sacred Coast Salish time-honoured tradition of ‘welcoming,’ with the raising and unveiling of the first-of-its-kind ceremonial Welcome Pole on the field of the Junior School. The hour-long ceremony was a dedication and a demonstration of our school’s commitment to respecting, honouring, and furthering the education and understanding of our Indigenous peoples’ cultures, here on the Island, and across Canada. SMUS strives to continually educate its community and staff about “Ten Strands” that we have identified as our goals to help move us forward and become better neighbours. Ceremonies such as this one allow us to reflect this commitment to being respectful citizens by honouring our Indigenous friends in ways that are meaningful to us all: through the installation of traditional First Nations cultural pieces in prominent places.  The masterful Welcome Pole is the work of SMUS Artist and Carver and Scholar-in-Residence Dylan Thomas. His carefully crafted piece was on full display, all 12 feet–its colours and etchings vibrantly lit by the noon-hour sun at the time of its unveiling. Not only does Thomas’ work capture his Coast Salish ancestral heritage, but its richly scented red-cedar body is intended, as Head of School Mark Turner said in his welcome speech, “ to prepar[e] young people for their travels in this great land.” At the ceremony’s opening, students in groups of four donned blankets in a traditional style, as a symbol of the ancestral protection surrounding them as they set forth along their learning pathways. Guided by Elders Willie Pierre and Bill White, the students walked in procession while Mr. Pierre sang and drummed a Coast Salish welcoming song straight through to the Welcome Pole. There, the students (who each contributed their markings to the back of the pole) brushed the totem with cedar boughs “to help make it come alive for another day and time.” “On behalf of St. Michaels University School, Willie Pierre will work with the students to welcome the pole to our school grounds and to celebrate the gifts and stories it, too, will carry,"" said Turner. “This truly is what Reconciliation is about. Our goal throughout is to recognize a protocol that is traditional enough to be recognized and accepted by the ancestors of the people who have lived on these lands in time immemorial."" Staff and honoured guests visited this new cultural piece–the latest to to grace the Junior School since the Trottier-Morgan Annex debuted this fall. Jennifer Fletcher, an advisor to SMUS's new Indigenous Liaison David Lynch, noted that the Welcome Pole and its witnessing met with “our goal to make sure our Indigenous work is done respectfully and [with] honour.” “It was so impactful that the school embraced it,” she said. “It means that events like this resonate with the school community because they have a basic understanding of why it’s important and what it means. Every time the school does something like this, it just further embeds this [understanding] in their daily experience…the understanding of what their role is and what our goal is.” Elder Bill White of the Snuneymuxw First Nation, and SMUS’ formal Indigenous Guide, noted how this week’s pole-raising ceremony was a “very significant event.” “The school is interested in establishing stronger ties with the peoples of the region. [Our] events have been very focused on the environment, and the school is big on that as well,” said White, noting that while artist and carver Dylan Thomas may be “young,” his art transcends tradition through time and space. “He’s producing art in the classic Coast Salish way, using their design elements, and updating it as well, and so that gives it significant strength and credence,” he said, explaining that Coast Salish artwork practically became non-existent during the 1970s. “Dylan is doing an amazing job of bringing it around again, beautifully.” Thomas’ pole, his first as an artist, encompasses the etchings of four sacred animals, one of them being the thunderbird, which, in flight, noted  White, “causes thunder to be heard."" ""Out of his eyes light brightens the lands. The old people told everyone to use old rights and ceremonies to protect and surround.” For his part, Thomas thanked our school for welcoming him on as Scholar in Residence and for providing him with the opportunity to share his artwork in support of SMUS commitment to its Indigenous teaching- and learning journey. “As an artist, carving your first pole is a very, very significant moment in your career—and because of all your help I was able to do two poles,” said Thomas, in his post-ceremony speech. Claire Lawler, a SMUS Grade 12 boarding student, who was part of the ceremonial procession, said the Welcome Pole dedication was meaningful for her, especially as a witness who hails from South Africa. “Just being a part of the Canadian Indigenous ceremony has been an awesome thing to witness. It’s amazing to see how Canada is taking steps forward to repair the bonds with their Indigenous communities,” she said. Mark Turner noted that this most recent ceremony is yet another example of “what we’ve been doing to move our Indigenous learning journey forward."" ""We’re on a learning journey and that’s why we’re so grateful to have the advice of our elders Bill White and Willie Pierre. And, it’s so important to have had Keven and Jen Fletcher, and now David Lynch, as our Indigenous Liaison who make sure that we honour Indigenous protocol with respect. ""We start from this position where we want to do things right, and we want to respect them, and that makes it paramount that we remain receptive to the advice we’re offered.” Currently, Thomas is busy at work on his second Welcome Pole which will be raised and dedicated in ceremony on the Richmond Road campus sometime in the new year.

     As the Director of Senior School, I have the great privilege of seeing our students move about their daily lives at the school. I get to see them in their classrooms, in their clubs and councils, on the sports fields and in their music practice rooms, and also just generally socializing during their recesses and lunch hours. With that said, I am also very cognizant of the fact that much of their achievements this year are out of sight for all of our parents. Without athletics on display, performances to watch, music to listen to, art shows to attend and the myriad other ways that our students are normally able to display their many talents, I can appreciate that it is very easy for our families to feel a bit disconnected from what their children are up to at school all day. I can assure you that they are achieving a great deal! As you know, we have the good fortune of being in-class, in-person, and I am constantly reminded of the importance of this human connection as I walk about the campus. I see classes engaged in science labs, deep discussions and interesting debates, I see groups of students gathered in our library study rooms poring over assignments, I see clubs and councils thinking creatively about how to engage with the student body in different ways and I even get to see our students enjoying their down time during recess and lunch. To be honest, once one is within the walls of the school, it almost feels normal. Of course the “almost” in that sentence hangs there for us, and so we continue to look forward to a time when we can all more easily celebrate the successes of our students in person. Until then, know that we appreciate all that they do and we continue to be amazed by their progress in all facets of school life. You should be proud!

     One of our Jubilee year projects is ""Waiting to Be Remembered - Stories from St. Michael's School,"" a collection of incredible stories of connection and coincidence involving St. Michael's School Old Boys, researched and authored by Michael Nation (SMS '70). Between January and June 2022, we will release stories by Michael Nation and we hope you will enjoy reading them. A marriage proposal like the following (especially when it’s delivered over the phone at 2 am) is unlikely to be a huge winner: “I’ve just bought a wooden toilet seat that I think will fit very well on top of that pail on the boat. It’s sky blue, and I paid $8.50 for it.” But it worked for one St. Michael’s School Old Boy. ---- John Heywood Daly attended St. Michael’s School from September 1921 to June 1927. His father, John Joseph Heywood Daly, was a Manxman of Irish descent but spent most of his adult life as a rancher in Montana. Born in 1877, Heywood emigrated to the United States in 1896, choosing the dry air of Montana because of his tuberculosis, but also spending two years (1904-1906) working cattle in Argentina. John’s mother, Muriel Broadbent, was an Englishwoman, from Cheshire. Returning to England, Heywood married Muriel in the county town of Chester in January 1908. She may have remained in England for a few years because she was enumerated in the 1911 England and Wales census at her mother’s cottage in Chester with her younger sister Dorothy. But she had joined Heywood in Montana by early 1912, and her mother and sister followed that year. Mrs. Broadbent identified very strongly with the British Empire and was unhappy with the prospect of her first grandchild being an American. So the birth took place in Canada: John was born in Vancouver on Halloween day in 1912. In 1920, the majority of the family – Muriel, John and Mrs. Broadbent – moved to Cherry Point on Cowichan Bay, Vancouver Island. Heywood came from Montana for short visits during the winters, and John spent many summers on his father’s ranch in the US. Perhaps because of the ‘imperialist’ proclivities of his maternal grandmother, John was sent to St. Michael’s School, the kind of school – set up ‘along English public school lines’ – which was then thought to produce the next generation of gentlemen leaders of society. He was neither a top athlete nor a leading intellect in his class, but he must have been steady and mature as he was chosen one of the four school prefects in Grade 9, his final year. A strapping young man by then (he grew to be 6-foot-4), he had rather an adult face at an early age. After finishing St. Michael’s he was sent to another private boarding school, this one much further away, in Sedbergh on the edge of the Yorkshire Dales in northwest England. He was very homesick and unhappy for the three or four years spent there until he had to leave. As a result he came to hate English-type private schools, and returned to Canada with an abhorrence of the British class system. Yet St. Michael’s can’t have been as unhappy a school for him as Sedbergh because he became a member of the Old Boys Association (buying a tie) and kept in touch with the Symons family over the years, leaving addresses through which school newsletters could reach him. The old Headmaster (Mr. K.C. Symons), while vacationing on his own boat in August 1954, even dropped in to see John at his home in Garden Bay, Pender Harbour on the Sechelt Peninsula – but of course John was away fishing. He was on the Pender Harbour school board for several years in the late '50s and early '60s, and was an active member of the Parent–Teachers Association. In 1960, the high school had an exceptional principal. She set up a course on commercial fishing and got it approved as a two-year credit course by the Ministry of Education, the first such course developed outside of Victoria. The principal relied upon John for much of the material for the classes and he helped teach it. ---- John fished for 44 years, from the time he bought his first troller in 1934 at the age of 23, until his sudden death in 1978. Over the course of his commercial fishing life he owned a series of five trollers: Snark (1934-1937); Muriel D. (1937-1940); Muriel D. II (1940-1945); Kelp (1946-1952); and MoreKelp (1952-1978). He became well known and well respected along the length of the BC coast. He also earned a reputation as a very successful fisherman, who followed his own instincts as to where the fish were and how to catch them. He observed that “… there is a factor some men develop and others have naturally and still others never seem to attain – that elusive and indefinable instinct, plus the ability to be able to think like a fish. I believe those humans who attain this somehow reach back into time and their evolution and ‘tune themselves in’ on those instincts we once possessed for survival several millions of years ago.” He fished alone for most of his career, though both his sons learned to fish with him. He rigged his troller with four helms or steering wheels so he could always handle the boat from wherever he was working on it. In 1974, William Shawn, the legendary editor of New Yorker magazine assigned one of his experienced writers to work up a story on BC’s commercial salmon fishing industry. Early in the course of her research, Edith Iglauer was advised to talk to a troller named John Daly. Very quickly successive interviews turned into a wonderful love affair. When Edith first went aboard the MoreKelp, John’s last boat, she discovered it had no head. Accustomed simply to “going” over-the-gunwales when out fishing by himself, Daly, out of consideration for his new friend, installed an aluminum pail on the outer deck. The bucket and its accoutrements became the context of his marriage proposal. Edith’s response? “What a proposal! How could I resist him, and why should I? I laughed myself to sleep.” ---- At our archives in the spring of 2021 I was trying to identify John in the collection of St. Michael’s School pictures. I Googled his name and up came a book I had heard of, but not read, many years ago: Fishing with John. That was when I first made the connection between the book’s author, New York socialite and writer Edith Iglauer, and “our” John Daly. But in the reportage about the book there was almost nothing about him apart from his name – and no photo. It was all about Edith. That bothered me. It wasn’t John who gave up his fishing life on the West Coast to move to New York (he disliked cities: “We are outdoor-equipped – for outdoor lives, not cities.”). It was she who toted her duffle bag across the continent to a 41-foot troller based in a tiny bay on the Sechelt Peninsula. She made an extraordinary decision; but John was an extraordinary person. John Daly was not the only St. Michael’s Old Boy who became a commercial fisherman. At least three others of his school era did the same: brothers Paul and Jack Homer, and Bert Higgs, all of whom had communications with the school (sometimes through John) for many years. For a while early in their fishing careers, all four were based in Bull Harbour on Hope Island, just off the northern tip of Vancouver Island. In October 1936, their boats were called Teola (Paul), Oceanis (Jack) and Monabell (Bert). John was also a close friend of members of the Chambers family from his childhood, and later two Chambers brothers were trollers like himself. Some of the news about John was reported to the Symons family by another St. Michael's Old Boy, Graham Chambers ’33, three years behind John at the school. I know of one very successful fisherman from my own time at the school, Bob Fraumeni. Bob was only a young deck hand when he met John in Port Hardy in the mid-'70s. He also kept in touch with Edith until the end of her life, at 101, in 2019. After John died, a long-time Pender Harbour resident and friend of John’s donated four acres of his land for a regional park to save a salmon spawning stream that runs through it. He gave it the name John Daly Nature Reserve. Commercial fishing is dangerous and difficult work. As John told Edith, “On the water, you have to keep in mind all the time that the sea is out to get you. Treat the sea as if it is always trying to get you. It’s the only way to survive. You can never really relax. Never!” Only a small proportion of men, and even smaller of women, manage it well. Still fewer love it and feel at home on the water. John Daly was one of those. “John turned off the motor and we drifted, gliding silently on the rippling sea. ‘The choice in views for beauty along this British Columbia coast completely overwhelms me,’ he said. ‘I love it so deeply that I want to put my arms around all of it. I want to pour the whole coast over myself.’” Michael Nation (SMS ‘70) has been volunteering in The Wilson Archives identifying boys in the series of St. Michael’s School photographs going back to its beginning in 1910. If any reader knows another St. Michael's School story which should be resurrected, please contact him through The Wilson Archives.

     This year, the Canadian Secondary Schools Rowing Association (CSSRA) recognized Susanne Walker Curry for her years of service to high school rowing by presenting her with a Lifetime Service Award. Susanne was honoured with the esteemed accolade during the 2023 CSSRA Championships held in St. Catharines, Ontario.

Award recipients must have served high school rowing for at least 25 years. Susanne surpassed that mark through her 11 years at Brentwood College School and 17 years at St. Michaels University School. Nevertheless, the essential prerequisite for Susanne was the need to have contributed to high school rowing by creating innovative, influential, and motivational initiatives. As Head of the SMUS rowing program, Susanne is known for her ability to develop well-rounded individuals and prepare them for the challenges of life in general, not just in sports. Just one of the highlights of Susanne’s commitment in recent years was the program she ran during COVID. When COVID first resulted in students being sent home, she implemented virtual fitness training sessions. Despite the time differences around the world, she had athletes from across Canada and the United States, England, Germany and Hong Kong who continued to participate as part of the team, despite some of them knowing they would never have the opportunity to row again for SMUS. Even when classes began but restrictions still applied for sports, Susanne moved the dryland training outdoors so athletes could continue their training while respecting the COVID restrictions. Firinne Rolfe ‘21 was offered multiple scholarship opportunities when she graduated. She credits Susanne with promoting healthy competitiveness and a love of hard work. She said Susanne always believed in her and pushed her to be the best version of herself. “She has always believed I could achieve things before I have had the confidence to believe it myself.”

This sentiment was echoed by Nathan Yang ‘20 who noted “She believed in me even when I didn’t believe in myself.” He said that Susanne, through her critical yet compassionate approach to every athlete in the program, had an incredible impact on his life and development as a student, athlete and human being. Parents of athletes in the rowing program have observed the impact Susanne has had on their children. Dan Sheehan noted that Susanne’s “ability to transform kids from non-athletes to Canadian champions is truly miraculous. It is through her inspirational teaching methods and her true love for each and every member of her team and fellow coaches that she is able to create transformative change.” The life lessons learned from Susanne will carry these young people long into the future. Martin McElroy, who was not only a parent but also an Olympic Gold medal rowing coach, understands the demands and stress of the job. According to Martin, being a professional coach was relatively easy when compared with running a program in a school environment, balancing the demands of school, academic and sporting life, and maintaining a position as a teacher. Martin said he helped with coaching whenever he was able, but he felt the SMUS rowing program may have helped him more than he helped the program. “Watching young athletes have fun, seeing them develop as individuals, and see them come together selflessly for the team was a reaffirmation of the power of sport to me. There is no question that the hub and source of the energy that propels the SMUS rowing program comes from Susanne.” Sarah Hagkull ‘16, current SMUS rowing Assistant Coach, credits Susanne’s empowering mindset and leadership with bringing her to the position and profile she currently has at the school, and in life in general. She reflected on how she learned that whether sitting at the starting line, crossing the finish line or walking through the hotel lobby, she represented the school, team, families, and coaches, as well as herself. Susanne’s passion for the rowing program and her athletes is evident in both the program and her rowers. She has not hesitated to bring in other professionals to support the athlete development, including a former athlete who now has a career in Los Angeles, to host an online scavenger hunt on campus for team members. The athletes were having so much fun they didn’t recognize the teambuilding and fitness aspect of the activities until the event was finished. Susanne also engaged a sport psychology professional to support the athlete's development. In these cases, the individuals donated their talents and time out of respect for Susanne. That respect and passion is evident even at the local regattas where SMUS rowing alumni returning from university regularly volunteer their services to help at major regattas and encourage current team members. Nathan Yang ‘20 summed it up best when he said “She is much more than just a rowing coach; she is a teacher, leader, mentor, and most of all – family. One team, one family.”

     Below the surface of the Pacific Ocean, where it meets the rugged central coast of BC, lies a mainly unseen and devastating problem. Marine debris large and small – lots of plastic foam, rope, bottles, and fishing gear – litters the shoreline, embedding itself into the ecosystem and endangering marine life. “In a way it's kind of a slow-moving, hidden problem. While we usually find some things tossed up, even we didn't realize the extent of it,” says Maureen Gordon ’88, co-owner of Maple Leaf Adventures. “What I found really interesting was hearing about walking up the shoreline and then stepping into the forest, and stepping onto basically a surface of plastic bottles covered in moss on the forest floor.” Maple Leaf Adventures is a Victoria-based boutique expedition cruise company that Gordon co-owns with her husband, Kevin Smith. Their focus on regenerative tourism on the BC coast goes beyond the principles of ecotourism, as they aim for their ships to leave a natural destination in better shape than when they arrived.  “We love what nature gives us. It's part of our identity to create a business that celebrates that, that uses the beauty of nature without destroying it,” Maureen says. In March 2020, it became evident that BC’s tourism industry would be impacted hard by the COVID-19 pandemic. Maureen and Kevin, along with six other companies that make up the Small Ship Tour Operators Association (SSTOA), looked at doing something proactive. They were intent on creating a project that aligns with their goals of conservation and restoration, while keeping as many of their skilled employees working – from wilderness guides to onboard chefs. “We realized we had quite an amazing skillset from people who aren’t usually available. So we said, ‘Where could we go and what could we do that would be a benefit to the province or the country?’” Maureen says. “Kevin had been part of big beach cleanups off northern Vancouver Island when he was a park ranger. And he realized we could do this because we and our colleagues have these small expedition boats that are outfitted to live for weeks in the wilderness and that can access remote places.” With the Great Bear Rainforest chosen as the beneficiary of a massive-scale coastal cleanup, this group of tour operators wrote a proposal and pitched the project to the provincial and federal governments. They found financial support from the province through The Clean Coast, Clean Waters Initiative Fund. On August 18, the Marine Debris Removal Initiative began the first of two three-week cleanup expeditions on the central coast. Through the course of six weeks, 100 people cleared some 540 km of coastline. “It was a real eye-opener,” says Mike Jackson, retired SMUS science teacher who took part in both cleanups as assistant expedition leader. “I just had no real concept of the scale. … To go to places that hadn’t ever been cleaned and to see the huge amount of stuff that was there was crazy. It was powerful to be part of this.” The process for each of the three-week expeditions was that teams would spend the first two weeks putting as much debris as possible into massive bags and leave them above the water line in an open place. During the third week, a helicopter would pick up the bags – each weighing up to 300 kg – and drop them off on a barge for proper disposal. When the project was initially pitched to government, the group anticipated they would be able to remove 20-30 tonnes of debris during the two expeditions. That estimate changed within the first couple days. “On Day 2 or 3, as soon as we got to the outer coast areas, we realized that there would be bags and bags and bags of debris to collect. We actually had to shut down cleaning operations earlier than we intended because we wouldn’t have room on the barge for all of it,” Mike says. In total, the MDRI removed 127 tonnes of debris from the shoreline in the Great Bear Rainforest. They tracked what was collected over the course of the two expeditions and found that abandoned or lost fishing gear – nets, floats and lines – and aquaculture equipment made up the largest amount of debris. Literal tonnes of polystyrene foam, rubber tires and consumer plastics (from water bottles and food containers to buckets and rope) was also collected. In addition to Canadian and American garbage, the group found debris originating from the other side of the Pacific Ocean: Japan, Korea, Taiwan, China, Russia, Philippines, and Indonesia. “You have all of this stuff littering the coast, but the problem is that plastic and foam breaks down into smaller and smaller chunks until you've got little pieces that are a few millimeters in size,” Mike says. “The microplastics basically get into the bodies of all kinds of marine organisms through the food chain, and the chemicals that are in the plastic can have a physiological impact and cause damage to those organisms. [The scientific community doesn’t] yet know the full scale of the impact of this stuff on organisms and the environment.” Maureen reflects on her English literature classes in Grades 11 and 12 at SMUS as being instrumental in shaping who she is and the type of business she and her husband now run. “One of the most impactful experiences I had at school was a class I had with a teacher Grenfell Featherstone where we were looking at the history of ideas and literature. It really opens up young people's minds to what values can do in a society and how they can change the society and how you can become conscious of the values you find important,” she says. “I really think that that class, taught by that teacher, stayed with me as I now run a values-driven business.” Looking ahead, Maureen says the first MDRI was so successful that the SSTOA is looking to run a second cleanup, given that they expect another tourist season negatively impacted by the pandemic. “The size of the expedition was unprecedented in BC – if not Canadian – history. But we had to leave so much behind,” Maureen says. “We’ve cleaned one stretch but the rest needs cleaning, as well. The BC coast gives us our livelihood, so it’s only natural that we want to do what we can to preserve it.”

     Every day I get a front-row seat in my class watching the frustration on students’ faces transition to pure elation as they find solutions to problems they have struggled with for 20 minutes. It’s rewarding to see them push through a challenge and come out the other side feeling proud of their work and of what they learned. This is what it’s like every day in the Grade 9 Applied Design, Skills and Technology (ADST) course. In the course this year, students have designed and built a pachinko machine (think pinball, without the flippers) using a vector graphics software and a laser cutter. Then, they put their newfound circuitry and coding skills to use by integrating an Arduino microcontroller and programming electronic components that interact with the ball – making lights turn on, keeping score and making noises. Hard? Yes. Fun? Absolutely. ADST might look different at every school and includes many options that you might remember such as cooking, drafting and woodworking. When I took cooking and sewing as part of my home economic rotation in high school, it was about getting hands-on experience in unfamiliar territory. That’s still the same in ADST. What’s changed is the shift to prioritize the development of competencies: a combination of skills, processes, behaviours, and habits of mind. For example, in cooking class you may have needed to follow a cake recipe and then were graded based on its appearance or, if your teacher was brave enough, the taste. Instead, an ADST cooking class today would likely have you invent your own cake recipe by researching ingredients, creating a draft recipe, and testing it. That’s not to say the end product isn’t important, but it is more likely that the skills developed by going through the process itself will be more relevant in preparing students for life. For Grade 9 SMUS students, ADST is about getting an opportunity to apply their knowledge of digital design and coding to solve complex problems where there are no right answers. Asking students to create projects where there isn’t a right answer is key to developing and honing those competencies in a school setting. While these Grade 9 students are gaining hard skills such as coding, designing, and programming, those skills are secondary. This intentionally designed ADST course is simply the vehicle for students to develop important soft skills. The pachinko project prioritizes resilience, one of seven qualities that SMUS has identified as characteristics we want all students to possess. In 2018, the school’s Personalization Team, made up of teachers from all three schools and headed by Director of Academics Denise Lamarche, launched the Portrait of a Learner practice. This work brought to light the seven skills that we want all students to develop that will benefit them now and after graduation: curiosity, resilience, initiative, balance, integrity, collaboration, and empathy. “If you look at where careers are heading, there is a need for more than just what you know. It’s how you are able to work on a team, and how you’re able to communicate and collaborate effectively for ultimate success,” Denise says. Faculty across all grades balance academic rigour with skill development by planning lessons and schoolwork around both what students need to know and how they can demonstrate their understanding by applying knowledge to an inquiry question or real-world problem. Intentional thought goes into giving students experiential learning opportunities that help develop these seven skills in age-appropriate ways. “That’s what I think makes learning exciting today. Any time we have student demonstrations of learning, it highlights the depth of what the students know but also how they arrived at sharing what they know. No longer are projects all the same,” Denise says. “Now what you’re seeing is students bringing in some passion and bringing in other connections, and deciding that this is how they’re going to present their information. There are many different ways to answer a question or solve a problem, and students can tailor that experience to themselves.” Since the Portrait of a Learner launched, Denise says she has seen students develop and demonstrate these skills in very noticeable ways. “Resilience has had to come out in spades as students and teachers navigated the impact of COVID-19 with remote learning, timetable changes, cohort restrictions and more. I think about how our community has navigated all of that and the success that we’ve seen in the classroom and through many different demonstrations of learning, and I think that everyone has done an extraordinary job,” she says. Later this year, the school will begin to undertake a process to articulate the Portrait of a Graduate, which will highlight the experiences we want all SMUS grads to have embedded in their learning journey – from public speaking to outdoor education to leadership opportunities. While ADST was previously integrated into experiences throughout the Grade 9 year, the 2020-21 schedule changes allowed for the introduction of the ADST course into the timetable. When designing any course or any project, one philosophy is to start at the end. As teachers we ask: what do we want students to know, do, and understand by the end?; How are students going to demonstrate this learning?; And how am I going to assess it? By answering these questions, we can identify the skills students will need to be successful and structure the course or project accordingly. ADST lends itself well to project-based work as it provides the ideal setting for students to demonstrate their skills, while engaging them in the hard-fun experience we are after. Rather than assessing Grade 9 ADST students solely based on the end product, we are looking for students to be able to use the design cycle to inform the creation and development of their projects. It is an iterative process that involves defining a problem, researching and brainstorming ideas, building a prototype, and then testing it. The process then repeats based on the results of the testing phase. When are we done? Never! Although there are no right answers, we can always make improvements. We can always be better. It is this attitude and approach to life, along with the Portrait of a Learner skills, we hope students walk away with.

     The following Passages were shared with our community in the Spring 2021 issue of School Ties: From Creston, BC, Munroe entered University School at the beginning Grade 9. He was an avid athlete and became House Prefect in his final year. He graduated from UVic in 1969 with a degree in Psychology and Sociology, and then travelled first to England then to France to study French at the Sorbonne. From there he moved to New Zealand, earning his Master of Arts degree in 1975. Munroe continued living in New Zealand, working for the government. He returned home to Canada in 1977, settling in the family home in Sidney. He worked as an assayer in numerous mines throughout North and Central America. Munroe will be deeply missed by his family, his dear friends and neighbours, and by many of his friends from University School. Munroe was born on March 17, 1946 and passed away September 8, 2020. Born in Heilbronn, Germany, Wolf came to Canada with his family at age 7. Moving to Victoria from northern BC, he completed high school at University School in 1966. After he earned his PhD in Forest Sciences from Oregon State University. Dr. Binder (many friends called him “Doc”) was a research scientist in Victoria with the Ministry of Forests, Research Branch from 1981 to 2003. His extensive research has left a legacy of more than 100 science publications. He was an Adjunct Professor at both UVic and Simon Fraser University and a member of the Association of Professional Biologists for more than 20 years. In addition to his many scientific endeavours, Wolf enjoyed myriad activities including travelling, skiing, dancing, and golfing, and had a soft spot for dogs, especially German Shepherds. After retirement he followed his interests in astronomy and went from using his real pilot’s license to simulated flying on his computer! After a stroke, Wolf faced three years of challenges with courage and tenacity while keeping his spirit of generosity and kindness to the end. In addition to his family, several friends and former colleagues enjoyed regular visits with Wolf to share memories and laughter. Wolf passed away on June 23, 2020. Kimberly is affectionately remembered as kind and caring with a gentle spirit and a warm heart. She attended St. Margaret’s School for Girls before graduating from SMUS and later became a medical office assistant in Victoria. Friends and teachers shared that Kim had an optimistic outlook on life and an unwavering loyalty to her friends and family. Kim’s unique style, cheeky smile and ‘twinkle of mischief’ are some of the memories that will live on and be shared with her two daughters, Lauren and Lily-Ann. Kim was born May 25, 1979 and passed away February 23, 2020. Cameron started at SMUS in Grade 3 and graduated in 2010. His favourite activities were music and theatre, and he was always very proud to be associated with SMUS. He is remembered by his family and many wonderful friends as the most caring, pleasant, kind, and thoughtful young man. He had a quick and ready smile, a wonderful sense of humour and a selfless and charismatic nature. His parents, Bill and Sharon (both former staff and faculty members) and his sister, Heather ’08, loved him so much and were so proud of him and feel they’ve been blessed to have had him in their lives for 28 too short years. Cameron was born April 4, 1992 and passed in December 2020. Cameron’s Celebration of Life was held in the SMUS Chapel and can be viewed at sites.google.com/smus.ca/cbuckingham/home. Tim was a second-generation student at University School having followed in his father’s footsteps. He later graduated from the Royal Canadian Naval College but pursued a career in journalism, equipped with a BA from McGill. By the late 1950s, he was Parliamentary Correspondent at the Montreal Star’s Ottawa Bureau. Tim had an extensive career in journalism covering everything from the civil rights movements in Washington to the rise of Quebec Nationalism. He spent five years reporting on the Cold War and decolonization in Europe and Africa, and eventually returned to Canada in 1973. He continued writing and editing for many years, spending summers in his wife Carolyn’s beloved Annapolis Valley. Tim was born in Victoria on December 31, 1928 and passed away October 20, 2017. Born in Ottawa, John was raised on both coasts, thanks to his father’s naval career. He attended University School from 1948 to 1950 and went on to pursue accounting studies at Victoria College and UBC, obtaining the Certified General Accountant designation and spending his working life primarily in the federal public service, retiring in 1999. A believer in heritage preservation in Victoria, he restored his own home to its original 1903 condition and served as the treasurer of the Hallmark Heritage Society since 1976. More recently, he was involved in the restoration and conversion of Fairfield’s Ross Bay Villa. His community service was recognized in 2002, when he won the CGA Community Service Award. John was deeply dedicated to his family and will be greatly missed. He passed away after a brief illness in February 2020. A graduate of University School, Richard studied Economics at UBC and, after earning his degree and taking a gap year in Australia, he became an investment banker in Vancouver. Ten years later he started investing privately in a full-time capacity. His continuing success led to an active life as a philanthropist. His interests included environmental issues, organic agriculture, village development in Laos and, not least, his old school to which he contributed generously over the years and in his final bequests. He travelled widely for sport and leisure, and was regularly in Laos. There, together with his partner Miina, he implemented numerous development projects including schools, health clinics and community services. He is survived by Miina, his sister Jennifer and brother Nigel Hawkesworth ’62, and their children and grandchildren, to whom he was devoted. Malcolm was born in Victoria and grew up in Qualicum Beach and South Africa. He initially attended Brentwood College School from 1945 to 1947 but when the school burned down, he completed his high school education at University School. Malcolm was very involved in the sport program earning his First XI Cricket Colours and also playing a key role on the First XV Rugby team. In addition, he was a Lieutenant in the school Cadet Corps and graduated after a full two years of school activities, in 1950. He worked around boats and marinas for many years and, after graduation, had a fishing charter business in Qualicum, then worked in the Coast Guard all over the BC coast. He ‘retired’ to a life of gardening, where he created many beautiful gardens around Victoria. He will be missed by his partner of many decades, Barbie, his four children and six grandchildren. Malcolm was born April 27, 1931 and passed away May 24, 2019. Patrick attended SMUS for Grades 11 and 12 after attending both Glenlyon Norfolk School and Shawnigan Lake School. He referred to this as “The Continental Tour of Education” and made dear friends at all of them. Patrick had an entrepreneurial spirit, working at several different companies including his father’s for a few years and more recently he was passionately involved in a few start-up companies and focused on helping them grow into their potential. He is remembered by many friends as a ‘vibrant character’ who was warm, loving, fun, and a bright light. He will be missed by his family as one who loved fiercely and in return was fiercely loved. Patrick was born August 12, 1985 and passed away January 16, 2020. Duncan, originally from London, England, moved to Hong Kong in 1966 where he attended St. Paul’s Co-educational School before studying in Switzerland. He came to BC in 1974 where he attended SMUS and then Simon Fraser University. Duncan moved back to Hong Kong in 1987 where he later established Design Logic, an interior design company which he maintained until his death. Duncan was loved for his playful energy, enthusiasm, and love of life. He was a connoisseur of food and wine, and for a few years was a partner in a popular Hong Kong restaurant. Earlier, he raced cars in Southeast Asia. He and his wife Miranda married in January 2012. Duncan enjoyed travelling, not only with Miranda but also with his late brother Edwin and their mother, and he made frequent trips to Vancouver to visit his father, Edwin and friends. Duncan was born on February 20, 1961 and passed away on November 20, 2018. Rob was born in Kano, Nigeria but grew up in Victoria. He attended SMUS where he developed many lifelong friendships. Rob obtained his Biochemistry degree at UVic, his Recreation Facilities Management diploma at Langara College and his Mediation certificate from the Justice Institute. Rob eventually settled in the Okanagan with his loving wife, Katrina, and son, Michael, who were the light of his life. Throughout his long career in youth and family services, Rob used his own blend of humour, truth and life experiences to assist many of our most vulnerable community members. He was passionate about all sports as a player, fan and father. Rob loved a good debate but will more likely be remembered for his kind and gentle spirit. Robert was born June 27, 1961 and passed away April 16, 2020. Chris was a lifelong resident of Victoria. He grew up in Oak Bay and graduated from University School in 1956. “Moose” was a stellar all-round athlete, excelling in his chosen sport of rugby as a forward and travelling to Japan in 1959 with the provincial team as its youngest member. After working as a forest surveyor and marrying Sunny in 1961, Chris studied at UVic, and then joined University School as a geography and economics teacher and rugby coach. His wife also joined the staff at SMUS. Chris and Sunny were a loving team, who enjoyed collecting art, working on their old stone Maclure house, hosting friends and family, and travelling the world together. Chris’s second career was working with the province as a youth probation officer until his retirement. Students and former clients will remember him as a patient, kind and understanding man who always saw the potential in youth, used his authority wisely and led with compassion. He loved a good conversation, a good laugh and good company. Chris’s two children, Matthew ’83 and Lindsey ’85, remember him as a wonderful father and grandfather, who supported his children and grandchildren in all their activities – however strange to him – and encouraged them to pursue whatever brought them joy. Christopher passed away February 8, 2021. Nowell attended St John’s-Ravenscourt School in Winnipeg but around the start of the Second World War the family moved to Victoria where Nowell attended St. Michael’s School from 1943 to 1946. Nowell became a chartered accountant and later the Registrar at the University of Regina where he worked until retirement. Nowell married his wife Anne in 1958 and they settled in Regina where they built their home and raised their two sons, Rob and Doug. They would spend their summers and all available time at a cabin they built at Fishing Lake in the 1980s. Nowell made friends and impacted the lives of everyone he met, but the greatest impact he made were on his grandchildren who will carry his legacy and cherish his life. Nowell was born on May 10, 1931 and passed away May 25, 2019. Dermod spent seven years at SMUS, holding the position of Head Boy in his graduating year. While at the school, Dermod was involved in debate and drama and had a reputation for speaking up and advocating for worthy causes. His early hopes of becoming Prime Minister of Canada didn’t end up being his calling in politics. However, one could argue that Dermod left an even more impactful legacy. He attended UBC, worked in Edmonton for the Alberta Liberal Party and spent more than 20 years as a political consultant in Montreal. In 2004, he became director of communications and director of media for the federal Green Party of Canada ahead of that year’s federal election. After he left the Green Party, Travis served as executive director of the Canada-Tibet Committee, helping refugees and their families immigrate to Canada. Later, as the Executive Director of Integrity BC, Dermod focused his efforts primarily on financial electoral reform and advocating for political integrity and social justice. Remembered fondly by family as a ‘grand person’ with an old soul and a wry sense of humour, and by colleagues as a ‘political professional and activist who tried hard to make Canada and British Columbia a better place’, Dermod will certainly be missed by many. He was born on June 3, 1960 and passed away June 1, 2020. Monty attended St. Michael’s School until 1935 and then graduated from Shawnigan Lake School in 1939. He studied at McGill University until he was called to serve in the Second World War in Europe. Monty met Nancy Lang, a Red Cross ambulance driver, in Belgium in 1945; they were married in June 1946, in Nancy’s hometown of Toronto. Monty graduated from UBC Law School in 1949. After a short time in Toronto, they moved to Victoria, where he practised law until appointed to the bench of the County Court in 1962, at that time its youngest member. He served with distinction until his retirement as a Supreme Court Justice in 1997. Monty had a love for fly fishing the rivers of the world, participating in “all things Jane Austen” and myriad activities in between. He will be remembered for his kindness, generosity and wisdom. He was born October 14, 1922 and passed away May 15, 2015. Beta attended SMUS from 2009 to 2014. Those who knew her during her time at the school would remember her as a gifted athlete. Beta was a valuable member of the basketball and track and field teams, but she really found her home on the volleyball court. She later went on to play on the varsity volleyball team at Capilano College in Vancouver and was a member of the New South Wales team during a short period living in Australia. Beta is remembered by her SMUS community as someone who believed in inclusivity and equality, and she led by example with her openness and ability to make everyone feel valued and accepted. She will be missed dearly by her friends, family and the SMUS community. Beta was born January 24, 1997 and passed away on May 20, 2020. Gerald attended St. Michael’s School from 1949 to 1954. Gerry went on to enjoy a long career working for the Lands Branch of the provincial government, retiring in 2004 after 35 years where he made many friends with his fun-loving nature. Gerry was a natural artist; he painted beautiful canvases and enjoyed joining Karen, his wife of 30 years, playing their guitars. He loved soccer, and was a coach and referee both in Sooke and Juan De Fuca. He also loved playing golf and in retirement was the president for the Metchosin Seniors Golf Club. Gerry passed away in March 2015.

     This past Sunday our boarding community gathered for the first of what will be several “this is the last time we do this together moments” with our final House Games and community dinner of the year. These events involve the entire community, which includes boarding students and houseparents. While this is not the last time that we will gather as this community or in our smaller individual house communities, the events of Sunday do bring about a realization that in the coming weeks this experience of boarding is ending for many. Regardless of whether that experience has been one, four or five years in the making, it is incredible, even after all my years in residential life, to see how these students grow, mature and develop over this time. Most importantly, what I feel is great hope in the future as each year I get to witness young people from around the world learn to live, work and play together. It takes work, sacrifices, compromises, vulnerability and commitment on the part of the students to make the most of the experience. The reward for them (and us) is that they are developing a roadmap for tackling the truly great issues of the future that will require the global community to work together to resolve. The reward for me: shortly after our community dinner, I took my dog for a walk around the school field. With the sun beginning to set, many of the students still in their Sunday best from dinner were gathered in various groupings on the field or around School House. They were trying to capture the essence of it all with that perfect photo before the sun set, doing so with effortless smiles that can only come from a feeling of comfort and belonging.

     Dear Parents and Guardians, I am pleased to have this opportunity to remind you to take part in our parent survey for our Strategic Plan. We are now at the midway point that the survey is open, with the deadline looming on January 28. As previously mentioned, your views are really important to us. As the Board of Governors begins to identify our priorities for improvement and change looking forward to 2030, we are seeking to hear from the broadest possible opinion base. In fact, our research tells us that the consultation exercise that we are going through, in conjunction with RSAcademics, is the largest ever undertaken by an independent school in Canada. By the time the process is completed, we will have provided the opportunity for almost 10,000 people from our alumni base, faculty, staff, parents and student body to present their views, which will be combined with those ideas generated by our Board. Within the questionnaire, I hope that you will find that the blend of structured questions and opportunity for you to provide your own comments will allow the information you share to be collected and presented in a clear way. I am aware from personal experience that it is possible to have “survey overload”; with so many research projects going on, there is a tendency to delete new surveys or to park them somewhere out of sight and out of mind. Of all the surveys you may have received from SMUS, I would make a pitch that this is the most significant for feedback at a time when we are really receptive to hear it. As I sign off, I should like to take this opportunity to wish you and your families a happy and successful 2019.

     In light of the resurgence of concern about discrimination rising from the killing of Minneapolis resident George Floyd and the subsequent international protests that created conversation within our community, School Chaplain Keven Fletcher was asked to offer a reflection. Through a video distributed to Senior School students and all staff, he hoped to supplement our thoughts and connect us back to who we are as a school. What follows is a transcript of his message. Our school seeks the excellence in all of us, with passion and compassion. We are a community shaped by the pursuit of truth and goodness, providing outstanding preparation for life. When I was 20 years old, I walked up to a BC Ferries ticket agent at the Horseshoe Bay terminal and handed her a counterfeit bill. She looked at me and said, ""You know, I should call the police."" The previous night, my dorm had hosted an open party. It was our first so we didn't realize that if you don't keep your money table well lit, people might try to pass false currency. At the end of the evening, I turned in my receipts for supplies and I was paid back in cash from the till. The next morning, I got up very early and headed to the terminal. Striding up to the ticket booth, I pulled out my wallet and plucked out a bill, smiled, and handed it to the agent. Although I had no idea of what I had done, she was well within her rights to call the police. The darkest thought that passed through my mind was the recognition that I might miss the 7 am sailing. I had no doubt that I would be cleared of wrongdoing. I didn't worry about whether or not my dorm would absorb the loss and cover my costs. There was no scenario that played out poorly in my imagination. My only concern was that I'd have to wait another two hours to visit my then-girlfriend. Which is exactly as it should be. In the end, the agent accepted my story about the counterfeit bill, clearly appreciated my sense of urgency to get across the strait, and I made the sailing. Of course, it didn't dawn on me that certain factors played in my favour. I was a white, straight, cleanly dressed guy, who'd just arrived from a university campus located in a reliably stable community. At the time of recording my video to the SMUS community, the media has reported that George Floyd's arrest began with a complaint about a counterfeit bill. Given his violent death at the hands of four police officers, his outcome couldn't stand in starker contrast to my own. Which is exactly as it should not be. That the colour of one's skin might influence an outcome doesn't come as a surprise. I think that most of us recognize that various forms of discrimination play an active role, not only among our friends across the border but in Canada as well. For that matter, I'm not shocked that further south, Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador declared as 90% ""fake"" the 26,000 emergency centre calls about domestic violence logged in Mexico this March. I experience a similar lack of astonishment with respect to the poor treatment of the LGBTQ+ community in various countries or people from minority faiths or individuals with disabilities, whether physical or mental. I'm not surprised because I recognize the deeply lodged tendency to discriminate in myself. In this month in which we mark National Indigenous Peoples Day, I realize that I was raised reading textbooks that presented a mostly one-sided portrayal of our First Nations peoples. My childhood friends and I didn't talk once about whose culture was superior; it wasn't even a question. When I was young and wandering through my neighbourhood, I looked across a dirt path at the houses on the Musqueam reserve and the unspoken was confirmed. Somewhat older and walking downtown, I was taken by the number of homeless who appeared to be First Nations. Some of my young friends dropped disparaging jokes that, frankly, didn't cause me much pause. If you had asked me as a teen whether I tacitly accepted racism, let alone asked me if I was racist myself, I would have denied it vehemently and taken offense at the suggestion. I knew that all people were equal. I'd probably declare with a bit of pride, ""Race doesn't matter. I don't see colour."" Over time I came to realize that those last four words – ""I don't see colour"" - evidenced the deep flaws in my supposed enlightenment. I had a theory of equality in place, but it was mostly underpinned by ignorance and denial. I had much to learn about the fuller and darker history of our dominant culture's relationship with our Indigenous communities. I needed to spend time with traditional First Nations folk and practise suspending my own perspectives so that I could even attempt to understand how my hosts perceived the world. I also had to realize that this was tough, internal work that would take a long time. I'm still working on it. I've come to realize that I'll need to work on this for the rest of my life. And I'm not alone. What the horrendous death of George Floyd offers us is a stark reminder of our individual and collective brokenness and the tough work that needs to be done. Some of this is external to ourselves, right down to the nuances of dismantling current understandings of 'qualified immunity.' Equally, though, it's a challenging, inward journey. Our school's Mission speaks to this moment. At our best, we seek excellence, not passively or carelessly, but with passion and compassion. Rather than accepting convenient or conventional opinion, we pursue truth, however difficult. We remind ourselves that nothing is great unless it is good. When we're at our best as a community, this is how we prepare for life, including moments like now. Throughout the year at the Senior School, our Intercultural Council leads us in celebrations of our various cultural groups, everything from favourite foods to family dynamics. At the end of last term, students and faculty spoke on International Women's Day. A few weeks back, our Pride Alliance group led chapel, despite being spread around the world. This week, we'll focus on National Indigenous Peoples Day, which falls on the solstice after school closes. In these ways, we are finding a path forward. At the same time, we're called to delve more deeply. Our hallways are not free from hurtful comments and there are times when students don't feel equally respected or represented. I find hope in your willingness to bring these experiences to our attention and I encourage all of us to continue challenging our community. We need to relentlessly address these lesser aspects of our nature, not simply in this heightened moment, but in the weeks and years ahead. It is, after all, an expression of our Mission. What's our ultimate goal? Perhaps it's captured in a picture drawn by one of our Kindergarten students, Chloe. Her teachers tell me that at her age, students will often demonstrate their affection for staff by creating drawings to put on their desks. When Chloe told her teachers that she was working on a picture for them, it didn't seem unusual. When the picture arrived in March via email after the school closed over the pandemic and spirits were low, they were amazed. They described it as ""a sight to behold."" Chloe drew a picture of her whole class, all 16 students, eight boys and eight girls, each of them with their individual features, different skin tones and hair. Young Chloe took the time to think about each of her classmates and see them in all their colour. In her picture, the children hold each others' hands, flanked by a teacher on either side. Multiple suns and blue clouds smile down on the group. Until Chloe's picture becomes fully our reality, we all have tough work to do, both beyond ourselves and within ourselves, both in this moment and into the years ahead. Which is exactly what needs to happen, given who we are. Vivat!

     The 2018-19 athletics season came to a close last week. Of 24 competitive SMUS teams, seven captured City titles and four won at the Island level. Of 19 possible B.C. Championships, the Blue Jags earned berths in 14 of them. In the process, SMUS placed third in Junior Girls Tennis and Girls Track and Field, second in Golf and both Junior Boys and Senior Boys Rugby, and won a coveted ""Blue Banner"" in Tennis. In addition, athletes earned provincial bronze and silver medals in Squash, a bronze and two silver medals at the Rowing nationals, and a first-ever National CAIS title in Girls Rugby 7s. Other performances of note included Senior Boys Volleyball qualifying for BCs for the first time ever, while the Senior Boys Basketball team exceeded expectations by reaching the provincial AA semi-finals. Among many outstanding individual performances, Angelina Shandro dominated track and field and the Senior Girls 400m race, clocking a blistering 54.92 in obliterating the field. This time bested the national U20 standard by over two seconds. Likewise, Sonja Tang won medalist honours for Girls at the BC Golf tournament.

     While students (and staff) head into a well-deserved long Victoria Day weekend break, many students are taking the opportunity to practice their leadership skills this weekend on outdoor trips. On the senior campus, a key highlight for students in Grades 9, 10 and 11 are the annual grade trips. Coordinated by the Outdoor Education team of Pete McLeod and Craig Farish, these adventures are consistently cited as highlights in our graduates' reflections and are regularly referenced by our alumni who return to campus. Of course, our focus at the senior level at the moment sits squarely on the AP examination schedule and the challenges posed therein. However, it’s good to remember that often, the experiences that become most inscribed in our memories are those that take place outside of the classroom. It is the human connections forged while kayaking, sitting around a campfire or working hard on the training ground that bind us together as a community and build relationships that extend into adulthood. So, with just five weeks to go until the end of the year, we welcome the Grade 9s back and hope that they were able to make some fantastic memories, we wish all our athletic teams the best of luck as they head to the end of their competitive seasons and congratulate our seniors for a job well done on the completion of their exams.

     Detachment is a wonderful virtue to bring into focus as its positive attributes are so often overlooked. When we think about the gifts of character, it's virtues like honesty, respect and generosity that come to mind. Why would we want to practice 'detachment’? Aren’t we trying to practice 'attachment'? Detachment is a significant building block in maturity and self-development. It is not only noble, but it is central to our ability to be emotionally healthy and to navigate social relationships successfully. Detachment is being able to notice our feelings and thoughts, and make conscious choices to not be ruled by either. Detachment allows us to use a long lens, take in the big picture, and be more objective in our approach so that we respond instead of react! When bad things happen, our job is not to help children avoid difficulty, but to be able to handle it well. Detachment keeps us out of trouble by helping us avoid knee-jerk reactions. With detachment, we are free to do only what we choose to do. It is using our best thinking and it allows us to be our best selves. It requires that we bring a level of consciousness to the present moment so that instead of being controlled by our feelings we can moderate and regulate them. It involves meta-cognition, or thinking about our thinking. It’s easy to practise detachment and use good judgment when we are in the green zone. When we are upset and dis-regulated our pre-frontal cortex can prove to be elusive. That’s when we need ""a space,"" as explained in this favourite quote of mine: “Between stimulus and response there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom.” Whether we call this space a meta-moment, a breather or even a time-out, it’s an opportunity to stand back and use the breath to bring calm so that the child can get back to the green zone and the pre-frontal cortex can do its job. At school we encourage children to “smell the roses”: picture a rose bush in your imagination, pick three roses, each a different colour, now breathe in the fragrance of each rose, deeply, one at a time. Once we have a calmer child, we are ready to pose questions to support their ability to detach: “What am I feeling?” (name it); “How can I manage that feeling?” (tame it); and “What are some green thoughts I can tell myself right now?” (re-frame it). This may seem sophisticated, but even very young children are capable of using meta-cognition and practising detachment. They benefit from our modelling, coaching and providing feedback so that they know what it looks like and when they are using it – even if those moments are few and far between (“I noticed you didn’t lose your cool when your brother…”, “You have shown more maturity this week by…”). Of course there are times, when they don’t manage it, and these provide opportunities for reflection and planning, later (“What do you wish you had done?”, “If this happened again, what would you do differently?”, “If this happened to a friend, what advice would you give them?”). Remember that what we shine the light on gets bigger. Photo credit: Parachute Ball by Murdo McDermid via photopin (license)

     This festive season is made even more special with musical performances by our students. At the Junior School, we enjoyed our Grade 4 and 5 Strings concerts last week, the Carol Service this week, and look forward to our Primary Concert next week. Each of these performances provides children with a common goal to focus on while they are practising, the experience of going from “fine” to “excellent”, an opportunity to play for an audience, and the satisfaction of soaking in the reaction after a job well done!  Our music program is such an integral part of our school, fostering a love of music and finding its inherent beauty, all while ensuring a joyful experience. At the heart of this are our dedicated music teachers who provide students with transformative experiences through performances.  The intentional preparation begins with selecting repertoire that challenges and inspires, and introducing pieces that resonate with students. Teachers consider songs that meet the needs of differing abilities to ensure that a competent musician will be challenged, while a student who is developing their skills doesn't feel overwhelmed. This allows the students’ collective skills and personalities to shine.  The meticulous planning of practices and rehearsals ensures that each child is well-prepared for the performance. Every moment of class time is maximised, with high expectations set to challenge and motivate students. The result is not just a positive performance but a sense of achievement as a result of hard work and the realization that, through the efforts of each individual, the outcome of the collective becomes great. Having the opportunity to play for an audience is a crucial aspect of our program. Whether it's peers, parents, grandparents, or other members of the community, the presence of a live audience elevates the performance. Students learn to navigate the pressure and excitement, to remain poised, and then shift from practice to performance. This exposure not only sharpens their performance skills but also nurtures life skills such as resilience and adaptability. These musical showcases play a role in shaping the students' artistic abilities as well as their confidence. This, in turn, helps shape us as a community. The entire process is a carefully crafted journey toward success.  Whether the children are our youngest or our established Grade 12 musicians, our concerts showcase the school's unwavering dedication to musical excellence. As you enjoy the performances this year, I invite you to join me in expressing gratitude to our faculty, whose efforts have fostered the ideal conditions for every child to thrive on stage.

     Throughout Financial Aid February, donations made to support financial assistance at SMUS are matched by an alumni donor. We need to raise $300,000 in financial aid donations in support of this year’s Annual Fund. St. Michaels University School offers a world-class education that not only requires exceptional faculty, programs, and facilities, it also demands a diverse socio-economic student body. Having a range of talented students, regardless of their backgrounds, is vital to the SMUS community. Each year during the month of February, we celebrate our financial aid recipients and the donors who make it all possible. Financial assistance is given to students in the form of financial aid bursaries and scholarships. Financial Assistance is based on need, and scholarships are merit-based. We have 20% of our student body on financial assistance, and we do not intend to stop there. We have ambitious plans to increase the percentage of families receiving financial aid. To do just that, we need to consistently raise funds through our Annual Fund campaign and through building our endowment. We know that SMUS’s financial aid programs play an important role in the lives of its recipients – both past and present. Not only do they provide deserving students with an outstanding education, but it is also instrumental in helping them reach their full potential – as lauded by three amazing alumni: “I was fortunate enough to benefit from [financial assistance], and beginning in 1985, I found myself in a place where success was celebrated by the school community, where the encouragement to succeed came from every side, and where we learned to take pride in each other’s achievements,” says Neil Mulholland ’88, chair of the SMUS Alumni Association. “I benefited from teachers who taught me to think critically, to question everything, to search out alternate sides and approaches, to examine the available evidence through a dispassionate lens. I benefited from a peer environment in which learning, ambition and success were considered 'cool.'” “My most memorable experiences involved outtrips of all kinds  and taking part in the musical productions,” says Chiara Clemente ’13. “These are experiences that I would not have otherwise had in my life and I can confidently say that they played a part in shaping who I am today.” “With each passing year as a SMUS alum, my gratitude and pride for the school – and especially the financial aid I received – increases,” says Quinn Ngawati ’17. “I am proud to say that my SMUS experience and education have helped shape me into the man I am today.” With the continued support of our parents, alumni, and past parents, financial aid will have an impact on the success of the individual student and our school. February is Financial Aid February at St. Michaels University School. This month we turn to the importance of accessibility to the school through financial aid. Please join all the other SMUS community members, past and present, who have helped young people attend our school and enjoy a world-class education. Please visit our website to make your donation now to Financial Aid at SMUS.

     Remembrance Day is a time to reflect and honour those who have given so much to preserve our country's peace. Our Remembrance Day Service at the Junior School is a poignant ceremony every year, as we come together to share with our community the importance of this day and to recognize some of the former students and faculty who lost their lives in the First and Second World Wars. This year's Junior School service was pre-filmed and shared with our students, faculty and community on November 11. You can watch the complete service above.

     Academic achievement is one of the key strengths of a SMUS education. Lately I’ve been marvelling at the accomplishments of students across our school. There is amazing work and learning happening in Kindergarten through Grade 12. The months of April, May and June require an increased level of resilience and commitment to finish the year with strength and pride and an abundance of academic celebrations across all grades.  Our AP Capstone students have spent the last two weeks presenting their research papers, which also includes an oral defence exercise. One of the characteristics of SMUS's personalized learning environment is voice and choice, and our students really embrace this through the AP Capstone research process. The research questions students delve into vary and demonstrate their passions and interests. I have enjoyed participating in these presentations, as the students are professional, well prepared and demonstrate a depth of research skills that lend themselves well for university-level study. Next week, our 240 AP students begin writing 622 AP exams. I am confident that they will achieve excellent results following the thorough preparation they’ve done with their teachers. This year already, the students who wrote the English 12 Provincial exam in January performed well, with 32 of the 48 students achieving an 86% or higher, and six of those students achieving a 95% or higher. Although exams are only one marker of academic success, they are an important element in the learning process. During Term 3, our students balance many academic commitments in addition to their extracurricular activities, from math contests, science demonstrations and music performances to experiential pursuits and recitations. The success of our students does not occur without a dedicated and inspiring faculty to support and challenge them along the way. Diligence and focus for students of all ages will certainly yield excellent results to help them finish the academic year with strength and success.

     Last week we kicked off our return to in-person Jubilee celebrations by welcoming our Faculty Emeriti and past staff back to campus for a moving and joyful reunion. More than 50 Emeriti, guests and current long-serving staff gathered in Brown Hall to reminisce on their experiences in the classroom, as coaches and mentors, as houseparents and as leaders. “We know that our faculty are the reason students and families develop such strong connections to the school and that their work is integral to the sense of community we have here at SMUS. We are grateful for their contributions to the school and are delighted to welcome them back to campus this year, because the SMUS connection doesn’t end when they leave our school,” said Head of School Mark Turner. Past Head of School Bob Snowden was also in attendance and acknowledged the dedication of SMUS faculty, where it’s unsurprising to find careers of 20 years or more at the school, including his own 22-year tenure at the helm. “People stay because they can grow while they are here,” said Bob. “They are well-supported and able to pursue excellence within their careers while exploring new disciplines and interests.”  This is well demonstrated in the number of faculty and staff that have become published authors at SMUS."" Among the gratitude and reconnection of old friends, Emeriti Tony Keble, Mel Jones and Cliff Yorath regaled the crowd with stories of early boarding days, sport field trips and the antics of both faculty and students. It was a wonderful night to remember and acknowledge the SMUS careers, connections and experiences that last a lifetime.  We look forward to continuing our Jubilee celebrations and welcoming our whole community back to the Richmond Road campus at Alumni Weekend April 29 to May 1.

     The 2021-22 athletics season came to a close last week, marking a momentous year of competitive sports after an 18-month hiatus. Our athletes hit the ground running in September with team tryouts and didn't let their feet off the gas through the end of the spring sports season this past weekend at the last of the provincial tournaments. Over the course of the year, six SMUS team won Island titles and 12 teams qualified for provincial tournaments. Moreover, squash players and rowers left their mark on the national stage. Of particular note, the Field Hockey team earned silver at provincials, while the Tennis and Senior Girls Basketball teams earned bronze. Grade 12 runner Tion McLeish finished second in the Senior Boys Cross Country provincial race in the fall, and earned another two medals – gold and silver – at Track and Field provincials in June. SMUS squash players won two gold, two silver and one bronze medal at provincials, and another gold and silver at the SMUS-hosted Canadian Junior Squash championships. On the water, the Rowing team came back from nationals in Ontario with four gold medals and five silvers. Many top performers were recognized at the recent Athletic Awards Banquet.

     One of our Jubilee year projects is ""Waiting to Be Remembered - Stories from St. Michael's School,"" a collection of incredible stories of connection and coincidence involving St. Michael's School Old Boys, researched and authored by Michael Nation (SMS '70). Between January and June 2022, we will release stories by Michael Nation and we hope you will enjoy reading them. One of St. Michael’s School’s earliest Old Boys, Edward Aglen, entered the Sudan Political Service in 1930 and served there – in various positions and locations – for a quarter of a century.  Having worked his way up to District Commissioner (DC) for Darfur province in 1944, Edward was being flown back to the provincial capital El Fasher in a small plane. In the 1940s, the flight from Khartoum would have taken nearly three hours by visual flight rules. On landing in El Fasher, it was too late for the pilot to return the same day so Edward invited him to stay overnight at the DC’s residence.  During conversation at dinner that evening the guest told Aglen that he was Canadian, to which Edward replied that he had gone to school in Victoria. They discovered that both had been at St. Michael’s School. Thus – says the record of Aglen’s letter to his old headmaster K.C. Symons – was another Old Boy, Robert Branson, found after many years.  ---- Records in The Wilson Archives at SMUS reveal many meetings between Old Boys of St. Michael’s School in almost every corner of the globe. Some were bizarrely coincidental, like that of Branson and Aglen in Sudan. Others were intentional, established by letters between specific Old Boys. The network of parents in Canada also helped to keep former school companions connected with one another as they moved around the world. The Old Boys delighted in these meetings, and reported them to the Symons family, and requested each other’s’ addresses.  International crises like the Second World War accelerated the chances of reunions between former schoolmates at army camps, air force stations, and navy dockyards. But there were meetings in other circumstances as well.  ---- Robert Lauret Carroll Branson was born in 1914 in Northamptonshire, England but very early in his life immigrated to Canada. His parents lived on Sea View Road on Ten Mile Point. He was at St. Michael’s from 1922 to 1924 (no. 185 on the roll), then attended (in rather quick succession) the Model School, Shawnigan Lake School, Oak Bay High School, Mount Douglas High School, and followed this with tutoring to get his matriculation. For 1934-35 Robert went to the Boeing School of Aeronautics in Oakland, Calif., – the same flying school from which another Old Boy, John “Moose” Fulton, had obtained his pilot’s certificate five years earlier. He wrote to the Symons family from California early in 1935 and one month later visited the school.  Then there was a break in the contact for a dozen years – until his meeting with Edward Aglen. During that period Robert qualified for a short service commission with the Royal Air Force in January 1937, and in November that year was confirmed as a Pilot Officer. He earned promotion through the ranks and by the end of the Second World War was an acting Wing Commander with a Distinguished Flying Cross. In 1946 he was awarded an O.B.E. for his services.  Soon after the war he found employment with Sudan Airways, based in Khartoum. His last card to the Old Head was in December 1953, still from Khartoum where he was Chief Pilot for the airline, but he continued to receive the school “circular” (newsletter) for a few years more.  Branson retired from Sudan Airways and returned to the United Kingdom to work in the government’s civil aviation authority. By 1973, he was one of four Principal Flight Examiners in the Flight Operations Directorate, Department of Trade and Industry.  Robert died April 6, 1980 in Sevenoaks, Kent, aged 64.  Edward Francis Aglen was born in then-Pekin, China, in May 1907, where his father was the Inspector-General of the Chinese Maritime Customs Service, employed by the Chinese government. Edward, too, spent only a short stint at St. Michael’s School, April 1918 to April 1919 (no. 72 on the school roll), following which he was at Winchester College, in Hampshire, England, where he completed his secondary education. He read PPE (Philosophy, Politics and Economics) at Magdelen College, Oxford, for four years (1926 to 1929), from which he passed out with a 2nd class Bachelor of Arts degree.  Graduates from British universities with the best degrees usually had their pick of employment with the “plum” Indian Civil Service. But a by-no-means unworthy second best choice was the Sudan Political Service (SPS), and Edward travelled out to Sudan on the M.V. Cheshire in September 1930 with the biannual ‘class’ of new SPS employees.  Edward was first posted in Khartoum but was soon an Assistant District Commissioner (ADC) in Kordofan province. After five years (1931 to 1935) in Kordofan, which is desert, he became an ADC in Upper Nile province, flat, swampy terrain inhabited by the pastoralist Nuer, Dinka and Shilluk tribes. From 1939 to 1941 he was ADC then DC in the agricultural Gezira province, and in Blue Nile province on the Sobat River close to the Ethiopian border, 1942 to 1944.  In spite of his busy life, Aglen wrote the Old Head many long, descriptive letters: From 1944 to 1948 he was posted back to the desert, the western-most province Darfur, where he met Robert Branson. For his final seven years in the SPS he served in Khartoum, first with the Executive Council, then as a senior official and finally director of the government’s Department of Economics and Trade. He retired from the service in November 1955, the year before Sudan achieved independence.  Aglen returned to the U.K. and got a job in Edinburgh as the Secretary of the National Association of Scottish Woollen Manufacturers, a position he held until 1972. In 1959, he sent K.C. Symons a Christmas card from Edinburgh with a photo of him and his family.  In one letter to Kyrle W. (Sonny) Symons in 1969 – after the Old Head’s death – Edward wrote, “Although I am rather hazy about my time at St. Michael’s I firmly believe that my short stay there taught me a lot.”  He was created an M.B.E. in 1973, and died in Edinburgh in April 1993.  Unfortunately, neither Edward nor Robert can be identified in the early school photos. If any reader knows how they might be identified, please contact the archives.  Author Michael Nation spent four happy years in Sudan, including in several places in which Edward Aglen and Robert Branson worked. He has even flown from El Fasher to Khartoum. He never discovered any Old Boys but met many impressive Sudanese men and women.

     Welcome to SMUS Olympic Club! The Grade 5 students have gathered in the gym and are starting a year-long journey in which they will be introduced to the heritage, stories, values and traditions of both the ancient and modern Olympics. They will meet pioneers of social justice like Ethelda Bleibtrey. Tired of swimming in long woolen dresses, Ethelda refused to conform and appeared at the 1920 Antwerp Games wearing what we now consider to be a standard swimming suit. There was initial uproar, swiftly followed by acceptance. The Grade 5s will learn about athletes like Cathy Freeman, the first Aboriginal women to win a gold medal (400m) and who was also the torch bearer at the Sydney Games. They will meet Abebe Bikila, the first African gold medalist – marathon running – who won his race running barefoot. The stories are rich in detail and diverse in content. They will learn how ancient and modern historical events (such as world wars, societal attitudes) have influenced the Olympic Games and shaped its current form. The students in this club are expected to think critically. They are posed a question: ""Hosting an Olympic Games is a massive undertaking that consumes vast sums of money and resources. The question is not, 'Can we host the Games, but should we host the Games?'"" They start to explore this topic through the lens of impact, legacy, urban regeneration, unintended consequences. They are shown examples of Olympic Games that have left powerful and lasting legacies for the hosts (London Olympics, 2012). They are shown examples of facilities in advanced states of decay and communities that struggle with the debt burden of hosting the games (Athens Olympics, 2004). The debates are rigorous and opinions are expressed that reflect a deep level of engagement. The Grade 5 students are also expected to express their learning using their creativity. They are currently developing a huge art piece to gift to the Canadian Athletics Team that will compete in the Tokyo Olympics. Participating in the SMUS Olympic Club is not just meant to be a scholarly pursuit. It is designed to provide inspiration and motivation for our young students to participate in sports and be physically active. They know, and are taught, how playing sports strengthens their physical systems. They know that playing sports provides joyful outlets for their abundant energy and gives them opportunities to learn life skills. We know that sports don't just build character, they also reveal it. Exactly how does this occur? Do sports values need to be taught or are they caught? The Junior School uses the principles of the Olympic Values Education Program to help the students develop values. By playing sports, our students learn and experience the joy of effort, they employ fair play, they pursue excellence, they have respect for oneself and for others, and they encapsulate it in a balance of body, will and mind. Back in September, our new cohort of Grade 5 students ready to start the Olympic Club was presented their first provocation: ""Imagine that it is 1896 and you have entered the Athens Olympic marathon race. It is hot, dry and very dusty. Greek patriots have promised you a dazzling range of prizes, if you can win and bring glory to Greece. You are promised free haircuts for life, one month's supply of chocolate, a plot of land to plant olive trees. Despite the stifling heat and the best efforts of your rivals, you enter the stadium in first place. The crowd goes wild. King George I of Greece summons you to receive your Olympic Medal and an intriguing prize: You can choose anything you want – just as long as it doesn’t belong to the King."" What would you choose? The debate ensues and the students are quick to identify suitable prizes. Examples include enrichment with inordinate sums of prize money, the creation of peace treaties between warring factions, and appointment to positions of power also seem to be popular. Olympic history gives us an example of humility. The winner of that race, Spyridon Louis, decided that for his prize he would choose two donkeys to help him carry and sell water to the villages in his community. Our first Olympic Club meeting ends with an invitation to further explore this topic at home using something we call 'conversations around the dinner table.' What lessons can be learned from Spyridon Louis? Why did he choose such a humble prize?

https://www.smus.ca/discover/governance-and-community,"   SMUS is thankful to have a dedicated Board of Governors as well as several organizations within our community who are working on a volunteer basis to benefit the school and our students. St. Michaels University School is owned by the SMUS Society, established under British Columbia law to operate an independent, not-for-profit, co-educational school.  Our community of alumni and parents are the members of the Society.  On May 2, 2024 the SMUS Board of Governors announced Dr. Jeff Aitken as our new Head of School, effective August 1, 2025. Read more about Dr. Jeff Aitken Head of School Mark Turner announced his retirement as of August 31, 2025. Learn more about the search process for the new Head of School A Board of Governors, elected by members of the Society, together with two appointed governors, support the Head of  School and Senior Leadership Team and autonomously governs the school. The Parents' Auxiliary work on a volunteer basis to support the school, other parents and the entire SMUS community.  The PA is an integral part of SMUS. They organize events and fundraise for the school. The Alumni Association Board and members are another important group within our community, serving the school's interests both locally and within our alumni community in 70 countries around the world. It is not surprising that given Victoria's location below the 49th parallel that one of the countries with most connection to SMUS is the USA. Through many years, the cross-border traffic has meant a thriving community of alumni exists south of the border, calling themselves the American Friends.

     At long last, we are so excited to officially announce the introduction of Junior Kindergarten to our community! Adding Junior Kindergarten has been a goal for SMUS for many years. We have been dedicated to our Reggio-inspired approach to learning at the Junior School and, at its core, this is a philosophy rooted in the earliest years of the school journey where children are forming who they are as individuals, constructing their knowledge and understanding of the world, and building skills to be positive members of a community. With the completion of the Junior School Annex next fall, we will be transforming our front two classrooms into a beautiful Junior Kindergarten for three- and four-year-olds that will spark curiosity, wonder and awe for our youngest learners. This will be a space that nurtures a joyful experience and cultivates every child’s unique voice and being. Our Reggio-inspired Junior Kindergarten is designed to help children discover their own excellence in an engaging and joyful environment that values each child’s capabilities and provides a developmentally appropriate place to grow. We plan to offer our first JK classes in September 2023 and are now taking applications for a limited number of spaces in our launch year.  This is an opportunity for families to join us earlier, setting the stage for the joy of discovery that lasts through Junior School and beyond, and ensuring a successful transition to Kindergarten and the rest of their journey at SMUS. Children in Junior Kindergarten will be valued as capable, intelligent, competent citizens of the SMUS community. We have taken the past year to intentionally design this program. Days for children will focus on imaginative play, social-emotional development, and exploring the natural world with curiosity. Our program will integrate the specialist areas that our Junior School students love - French, art, music, dance, tinkering, and much more.  We look forward to sharing more information about the program with you as we move into the first year of operation. In the meantime, we invite you to explore our Junior Kindergarten information page and to join us in celebrating this important step forward for our community.

     The yearly tradition of our school’s Remembrance Day Service has become a huge slice of my performing duties as the Senior School orchestral director, and it is the one that I take the most seriously. This is not to say that every opportunity to perform for an audience isn’t important, as it is the measuring stick that informs us musicians of our artistic growth, and occasionally informs where we need to focus our efforts more pointedly. But our Remembrance Day Service goes beyond its performance component because it isn’t about “performance” at all. It’s not about how well the orchestra plays, or what the choral selection is, or how well the drama offering lands. It is about the 134 names that are slowly orated as a candle is extinguished for each one; the school’s Roll of Honour. These are the 134 students and faculty who lost their lives in the First and Second World Wars. I have heard that roll call 30 times now during my three decades at SMUS, and as I have built a relationship of sorts with this list, it stabs me in the heart every time I witness it. I remember when former drama teacher Colin Skinner came up with the idea of lighting a candle as each name of the Roll of Honour was read aloud. The idea was brilliant, but the lighting of each candle took a very long time, especially when attempted by the shaking hands of a nervous Grade 12 student. With the switch to snuffing the candle, which is more poignant in my opinion, an important tradition was born and it has remained for decades. I have had many conversations with students in my classes about the service and I have heard, “It’s so long, especially when the names are read.” As we talk about who the names belong to, how young the boys were when they went off to war, and how they were the same age as many of these students’ older siblings, I see the flickering realization of the significance of the roll call on their faces, and the growing wisdom in knowing why remembering them matters. This year, the Remembrance Day Service looked very different, with it having to be pre-filmed and watched in class, rather than having the whole school community congregate in the gym. Although it is a shame that we could not come together for such an important service, I am pleased that the traditions continued: reading Captain Harvey’s letter, having a student play The Last Post and retired teacher Bill Buckingham respond on the bagpipes, and, of course, snuffing the candles during the reading of the Roll of Honour. As always, school chaplain Keven Fletcher found the lesson, the sentiment, the story to make the Remembrance Day Service relevant to the moment. And we will remember...

     What a week! The term is simply flying by, which at the Senior School means there is a lot happening around the campus. On Monday we held our first assembly of 2022 and it was fantastic to have all of our Grade 9 and 10 students in one space at the same time again. It has been a long time since we have been able to gather in this way. During that assembly, Mr. Primrose congratulated the students on their resilience and determination as we navigated through the latest COVID-19 wave. He also recognized their kindness and positivity, and encouraged them to continue to listen to each other and stand shoulder-to-shoulder in the days ahead and throughout their school careers. These are important community messages and we hope you can find a way to pick up on these themes at home. We often speak about how at different points in the year there are moments when our students are able to “make things happen” for the community. There are also times where they should not miss an opportunity to “watch things happen.”  Those making things happen show us what they are capable of in their areas of expertise and their talents serve to motivate us all in our own areas. It is important that we take the time to watch these things happen for our own sense of pride, and to take a minute to admire the work of those in our community. This week is a prime example of both of these types of opportunities. I hope that you were able to take in last night’s opening of SMUS Revue ’22, our Senior School musical. If you haven’t yet, tickets are still available for tonight and the closing show tomorrow night, and I would strongly encourage you to go. I can assure you that you will not be disappointed! It is the result of many months of rehearsals, singing practice, dance routine work, set-building – all amid shifting COVID-19 protocols. This is our first large-scale production since we ran Newsies in March 2020 and we are thrilled to be back on stage. All 80-plus students involved should be immensely proud of their work, and I hope you have the chance to watch them make it happen! Also this week, our basketball program is proving it did not lose a step during the pandemic. With six teams qualifying for their provincial tournaments, we can safely say, in terms of sheer numbers, this is our most successful provincial basketball tournament run ever. Congratulations to the Grade 8 Boys, Grade 9 Boys, Junior Boys, Junior Girls, Senior Boys and Senior Girls. These athletes have been making things happen on their own, without spectators, for two years. We now all have the chance to watch it happen at the pinnacle of their season. Special mention should go to the Junior Girls team, which headed into their tournament ranked first in the province. You can keep track of all of the action on each of the respective tournament websites. These are the moments where our students take positive risks and step outside of their comfort zones. This is when growth occurs and when students become new versions of themselves. Our students are an impressive group of young people that we should all be proud of. I would encourage everyone in the community to get out and watch them in action.

     One of our Jubilee year projects is ""Waiting to Be Remembered - Stories from St. Michael's School,"" a collection of incredible stories of connection and coincidence involving St. Michael's School Old Boys, researched and authored by Michael Nation (SMS '70). Between January and June 2022, we will release stories by Michael Nation and we hope you will enjoy reading them. Boys were taught a wide range of subjects during their years at St. Michael’s School. These are recorded in the early roll books which included, as well as daily attendance, marks for weekly tests, and every boy’s placing in his class for each term and for the year.  While the list of the subjects themselves remained quite similar over the decades, the content must have changed at least a little as theories and practices in education evolved. For example, I remember the introduction of “New Math” in about 1964. And Canadian and British history were taught in earlier decades, while the history period for the senior forms was renamed Social Studies in later years.  The subjects recorded in the roll books are given in the table below: From the number of periods each week (four) this was considered the most important subject. (No other was taught more than twice.) We obviously dealt with more advanced material as we progressed through the forms.  The aspect I remember most is the “times tables.” Arithmetic, like music, has patterns in it. If you can see the pattern, you can understand what is being “said.” That’s one value of knowing the times tables. Another is that you can do fairly complicated calculations in your head by breaking it down into parts, then adding the results together.  We had to learn those by heart in Form 3B (Grade 5), up to the twelve-times table. A boy could earn extra marks if he memorized the thirteen- and fourteen-times tables. Richard Beevers was the only person I can remember accomplishing that; and he was almost immediately promoted a grade.  For me, algebra included a lot of “neat stuff.” We solved many quadratic equations, with the standard form of: ax2 + bx + c = 0 These were solved either by factoring, by squares, or by using the quadratic formula. I found it fun to figure out these equations. (You had to be there, I guess.) In my class, Bruce Waring was probably the quickest at it.  I wish I still remembered some of my algebra because, occasionally, I come across a logic problem which I know I could solve using it.  The instruments for this subject were contained in a geometry set, which packed into a small aluminum box.  On 8½” x 11” sheets of light yellow paper, folded once to create a four-page signature, with margins ruled on, we drew out our geometry proofs with these tools. When we had completed our proof, we wrote “Q.E.D.” at the bottom. This stood (in Latin) for “quod erat demonstrandum” (that has been demonstrated).  Science studies were quite weak in my time (though it improved with the construction of a real science laboratory in 1966). Science was general, not split into biology, chemistry and physics; that separation didn’t occur until high school. Though not necessarily a master of any subject, Mr. Ted Piete was a “jack” of many, including science. I recall learning about minerals, and he once confronted me with the difference between avoirdupois weight (for all products except those subject to apothecaries’ measure, such as pharmaceutical items) and the troy system (for precious metals).  Every boy who ever went to St. Michael’s will remember – unless he has repressed the experience – the first page of the first lesson in Elementa Latina, the declension of the noun mensa, and the first sentence to translate: casa mensam habet (“The cottage has a table”). Even in those days I wondered why, over six years of study, we never reached the end of this small, blue, cloth-covered book. (See the Latin book at the top of this article.)  The school song was in Latin, and many Old Boys can remember the whole thing: “Cara pueris memoria / Sit Michaelis et victoria…”  I loved Latin, and would have liked to study some Greek too, but this was only taught in private schools at the secondary level and even then, in the mid-1960s, only barely. At University School, Cyril Genge taught just one or two students who specially requested it.  Longman’s was the textbook we used. We used student versions with an orange cloth cover. These were reused year after year by different boys. They were treated pretty poorly but seemed to last many years.  French was taught badly. After several years we had memorized huge vocabularies, knew a good deal of grammar, and were completely unable to carry on a conversation.  The junior forms were often taught general history and geography combined; the middle years, it was separated into Canadian and British history; in the senior forms in the 1960s, the period came to be called Social Studies.  In our Canadian history periods we were introduced to the early explorers; the coureurs-de-bois and fur traders; the North American wars between the French and the British (with the Hurons [Wyandot] and Algonquins on the side of the French, against the British allies, the Iroquois); and the Hudson Bay and the Northwest companies.  Forts built by both countries either appealed to, or numbed, our imaginations. By the French: the Fortress of Louisberg on Cape Breton Island; Fort Beauséjour (New Brunswick); Fort Michilimackinac (actually in, now, Michigan). By the British: Fort George (Ontario); Fort Amherstburg on the Detroit River at Lake Erie. And by the Hudson’s Bay Company, York Factory on Hudson Bay.  Needless to say, accurate references to Canada’s indigenous peoples or the government policies which affected them were not part of the curriculum.  While Canadian history seemed rather swashbuckling and exotic, British history was more like genealogy, our roots. I still come across names from those ancient days: the Romans; the Celts (Boadicea); the Angles, Jutes and Saxons (Hengist and Horsa); the Vikings (King Alfred, King Canute, Edward the Confessor); the Picts and the Scots; ”1066 and all that”; the Tudors and the Stuarts. It’s endless.  In Grade 4, Anglo-Saxon history was taught to us in simple verse: “Wessex, Essex and Mercia then race / for overlord’s place.” These may have been composed by the Old Head (K.C. Symons), to make the lessons easier to remember.  In my senior years, this involved very long sentences – or three blackboard widths in length – being written out by Mr. Quainton, and then the boys parsing them phrase by phrase. Hours of this practice certainly inculcated an understanding of the structure of a sound English sentence.  To quote Jack Knox: “Back in the olden days, the cumbersome nature of handwriting, the lack of a backspace key, forced people to take the time to really work out what they wanted to say before committing words to paper. Composition required care. (‘I only made this letter longer because I had not the leisure to make it shorter,’ French mathematician and philosopher Blaise Pascal wrote in 1657.)”  We did not, in those days, enter essay competitions. A few Old Boys have written memoirs, but I do not know of any who became prominent authors. One, Andrew Phillips, became a journalist and, ultimately, the editor of the Montreal Gazette.  I remember taking turns reading aloud in class from a text chosen by the master, and we received marks for this. There was also a reading competition in which junior and senior boys, in front of the whole school sitting in the gymnasium, read from a book placed on a lectern. No boy had previously seen the text, and each reader entered the gym in his turn, and so could not benefit from hearing the preceding readers.  All boys in the three senior forms (Grades 7, 8 and 9) also read the lesson at Prayers in the gym every morning before the first class. The rota meant that each boy read in front of everyone about three times a year.  I thought it was unfair to have handwriting as a marked subject because it had nothing to do with one’s intelligence. My writing was OK, but some very smart boys received lower marks than others simply because their ‘hand,’ though perfectly legible, was not considered to be cursive enough. The MacLean’s system, a “regimented style drilled into students across much of Canada for generations,” was the standard by which our penmanship was judged. The MacLean Method of Handwriting was developed in Victoria by H.B. MacLean, the first principal of George Jay Elementary School. Left-handed writers were not discouraged, as far as I can recall.  I find it hard to believe, and do not remember, that we still had this subject in the senior form (Form 5, Grade 9). But it is on the list in the marks books for 1966/67.  “Rep” was a subject with only one period a week. It consisted of memorizing (best done the night before, but sometimes in the recess before the period) a number of lines of poetry to recite in front of the class. The number – a pathetically small number – increased each year, from about eight lines in Form 1 (Grade 3) to perhaps 16 by Form 3A (Grade 6).  We could pick the poem we wished to work with, and continue through it over the weeks. At one end of the ‘daring’ spectrum, a boy would choose Lord Byron’s Childe Harold – Canto 3 (“There was a sound of revelry by night, / And Belgium's capital had gather'd then”), while at the other, Donnell Cameron somehow got away with memorizing lines from MAD Magazine. Tennyson’s The Charge of the Light Brigade was a favourite, and nonsense poetry by Edward Lear, like The Akond of Swat, was often recited in some eras.  We were examined in almost every subject, and the results were given as a percentage, not a letter grade. In the 1960s we were tested at the end of each of the three terms, and those marks cumulatively gave us a mark in that subject for the whole year. These marks then determined each boy’s academic placing in his class.  After reading through the old roll books with the marks and the placings earned over the decades, it appears that more was demanded of boys – it was harder to get higher marks – earlier in the school’s history than in later decades. In 1921, the boy in first place at the end of the first term (December) in Form 4 had an average of 62.6%. For the same term in 1935, 66.1% was enough to head Form 4A, and 72.2% to place top in 4B. The 1st place pupil in Form 4A at December 1961 had an average of 79.1%.  The top three boys in a class (academically) earned points for their school House (Black, Blue or White).  In a fit of “erasing one’s past” I threw away all my St. Michael’s reports in 1976 or ‘77. I now very much regret it. In fact, there are almost no copies of old reports in The Wilson Archives. If any Old Boys reading this still have theirs and would like to donate them, they would be gratefully received. It is a lacuna in the holdings.  ---- This was a 20-minute activity after the second morning period. In the early days it was taken by the Old Head, then by Mr. Ned Symons. In 1960, Bill Cochrane joined the staff; he had just retired from the Canadian Army as a sergeant-major and took over the duty.  The Drill period consisted of the boys “falling in” to one of three platoons based on their House. We formed up on the blacktop behind the school, “right dressed,” then quick marched out onto Victoria Avenue in “column of route.”  Under the Sergeant-major’s tutelage we became quite professional: one of his training phrases was, “Hands clasped but not clenched.” We drilled with wooden poles, 45-inch lengths of doweling painted in the school colours. Drill taught us to stand still and straight, to follow quite complicated commands in unison and in time, and to feel pride in looking smart.  A number of boys were appointed to the senior parade positions by Mr. Cochrane at the beginning of the year. There was a leader and second-in-command for each platoon, and a commander and second-in-command for the whole company when it was on parade.  At year’s end, a drill competition was held in front of an inspecting officer, in which the company of three platoons marched back and forth across the playing field behind the school, executing various manoeuvres, with the commands being given by the young Parade Commander. Playing marching music was necessary to keep time; even professional troops cannot march well on grass because the absence of the sound of their feet striking the ground denies them rhythmic feedback.  One or two years after I left, the company of three platoons was marching along Victoria Avenue one morning as usual when a passing car slowed down, rolled down the window, and a woman yelled out, “militaristic pigs!” The times had changed (the Vietnam War was on) and Drill was discontinued by the time of amalgamation.  This was not a “subject” but was nevertheless an integral part of school life, and participation was mandatory. We were divided into five groups in declining seniority: A, B, C, D and E, according to age, and physical size and ability.  These periods started after school was finished at 3 pm. We changed into our games uniforms and dispersed to local parks for the more advanced groups, or the school field for Group E. Soccer, rugby and cricket were the team sports played, but in some seasons “Games” period meant that we went for a long run. For the senior boys there was a road course of two and a half miles.  With five groups to oversee, five masters were required. The Head, Mr. K.W. Symons, had been a very good rugby player in his day but some of the other men were less expert than the more athletic boys. Only when the masters Michael Rippingale, David Clarke and John Harris joined the staff and were taking (supervising) Games did the boys feel that they had coaches who knew what they were doing.  Based on their performance during this period, the masters selected 1st and 2nd teams to represent St. Michael’s in matches against the other two preparatory schools for boys on the lower island, Cliffside and Glenlyon.  ---- If a boy progressed through most of the forms in the school, by Form 5 (Grade 9) he had a very solid grounding in English (grammar, composition, reading, spelling and repetition) and in three of the five branches of mathematics – arithmetic, algebra and geometry.  He could write a coherent sentence. He could speak or read aloud in public without fear or hesitation. He could add, subtract, multiply and divide in his head. Going on to high school many Old Boys who, at St. Michael’s, had placed lower down in their classes academically found themselves to be at the top of their class in English and Math.  But secondary school also revealed the frailties of our preparation. Science studies were weak (though they improved with the addition of a real science laboratory in 1966). And although English literature appears on the list of subjects in most decades, the study of it at St. Michael’s was very limited. I remember reading only The Snow Goose by Paul Gallico, which didn’t capture my imagination. (The book won an O. Henry prize so my literary faculties are wanting, obviously.)  According to the book Growing up British in British Columbia: Boys in private school by Jean Barman (1984), the goal of a private school education – at least in the eyes of upper-class British Columbians in the first half of the 20th century – was to build character and develop leadership ability. While this may have been the case for my father’s generation (he also attended St. Michael’s) I do not believe it was as consciously the aim in mine.  Nevertheless, this is what we sang about in the school song, though we never knew what it meant in translation: Cara pueris memoria 
			Sit Michaelis et victoria 
			Pro coelestibus pugnantis. 
			Atque in hostem trimphantis. 
			Hoc exemplo nos utemur, 
			Meliora nos sequemur, 
			Malum vincere conantes, 
			Quod Deo placet amantes.  Sanum corpus in ludendo, 
			Snam menem in discendo 
			Praebeat, et hic nitatur 
			Schola semper esse dignus, 
			Sui immemor, benignus 
			Quisque: dum parat, paratur.  Sic mundo servabit corde 
			Nomen scholae dignum laude, 
			Reddens, quod accepit, donum: 
			Sustinendo, laborando, 
			Supplicando, conclamando, 
			“Nihil magnum nisi bonum” Dear to boys may the memory be 
			Of St. Michael and his victory, 
			Fighting for the angels 
			And triumphing over the enemy. 
			Him we will use as an example, 
			We will follow the finer things, 
			Trying to conquer what is bad, 
			Loving what pleases God.  A healthy body in playing 
			A healthy mind in learning 
			Let each one offer, and let him strive 
			To be ever worthy of his school 
			Forgetful of self, kindly: 
			While he prepares he is being prepared.  Thus with clean heart he will keep 
			The name of his school worthy of renown— 
			Paying back the gift he has received: 
			By “keeping it up,” by working, 
			By praying, by shouting all together, 
			“Nothing is great unless it is good.”  Setting aside the more religious context of the school (and society) at the time the song was composed by founding headmaster K.C. Symons, there is much to take from it still, and much that is reflected in the ethos of SMUS today (“While he prepares he is being prepared”). The boys were educated to be respectful and polite (masters were always addressed as “Sir”), to stand up straight, and to shake hands with their elders.  Although the curriculum of St. Michael’s in its (first) 60 years lacked much practical training, most Old Boys have told me it gave them a very solid educational foundation. Together, the basic academics and good manners served as a fine “preparation for life.”

     We are incredibly proud to celebrate the graduating Class of 2023, and recognize their accomplishment in reaching this milestone moment. Our 151-member grad class is a group of exceptional young people and role models who are about to embark on the next stage of their lives – and we could not be more excited to see what the next chapter brings for them.  For many students in the Class of 2023, much of their time at the Senior School included the COVID pandemic. They overcame the hurdles that this presented, and have come out the other side as resilient leaders. During the graduation ceremony, Head of School Mark Turner commented, ""There is a curse of uncertain origin, ""May you live in interesting times"". The times you, young leaders, are inheriting, are most certainly interesting. There's no doubt that tomorrow we will need leaders of talent, compassion, integrity, and vision. Take hope and optimism in the fact that there are many here tonight."" These students of eighteen nationalities will head off to a wide variety of schools and countries near and far next year. One-hundred-twelve grads will stay in Canada, studying at eighteen different schools, while another seventeen students will study at sixteen American schools. Thirteen students will attend schools internationally in the UK, and a further ten students will be attending institutions in Australia, Asia, and the European Union. Four students will take a gap year to work, travel and take a year of discovery before embarking on their post-secondary pathway.  Below are excerpts from valedictorian Daniel Benjamin's speech, which you can watch in full as part of the Grade 12 Graduation Ceremony video at the bottom of this story.  Browse and download photos from the Grade 12 Graduation Ceremony on the SMUS Photo Gallery. Photos of members of the Class of 2023 on stage can be found by typing their full name (eg. Daniel Benjamin) into the ""simple search"" bar. Thank you to my classmates for electing me as valedictorian. I may not have won the coveted head prefect position, but I knew that eventually, my incredibly handsome face would win you guys over. 

Graduation is not only a time to reflect back on the fun and wonderful memories we have made and what we have achieved, but also a time to look to what the future holds. With the risk of sounding cliché, I’d like to offer some advice. We stand here today on the brink of a significant transition, far larger than simply from Junior School to Middle School or Middle School to Senior School. After sharing up to 13 years together, we are finally going our separate ways. It’s evidently a bittersweet moment, which I’m sure will cause some tearful goodbyes, but this moment holds the possibility to be a key turning point in our lives. 

As we go out into the world, with the goal of making a difference in our own unique way, we can look at this transition as an opportunity to accept and address the mistakes and regrets we may have had throughout our lives up to this point, whether it be in terms of school, personal relationships with family and friends, or in our own morals and qualities. Let go of these past regrets, but do not let go of the lessons you learned from them.

Between the already established social setting and comfortable familiarity of our actions, it can be difficult to take the time and courage to reflect on what we want for ourselves and actually commit to achieving it. The weight of expectations from others can also make it hard for us to identify who we truly want to be. Moving on from high school gives us all a chance to take that difficult step forward without worrying about the familiarity of ingrained routines and what other people think of us. While it may seem that we already have firmly ingrained identities, we are actually still in the process of forming them.

I want to recognize that while it is important to stay true to our values, don’t be afraid to inspect your ideals and search for ways in which you can aspire to be better. This is not an invitation to compromise your morals and beliefs simply for the sake of conformity with others’ ideas or in response to peer pressure, but an entreaty to look inward and think about who you are, and what you want. The American poet and philosopher Ralph Waldo Emmerson said that “to be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to change you is the greatest accomplishment.”  Look at these forks in the road, where you have the choice between a path often travelled which may not perfectly align with your ideals, or the option to forge one of your own, as tests of your character, and do not give in.

In our years together at SMUS, we have acquired a solid foundation, and we must build upon it. I hope that when we come back together for our class reunion, each and every one of us can talk with pride of what we have accomplished. 

I’d like to end with a final congratulation to our class of 2023. We did it!

https://www.smus.ca/boarding/food,"   Boarders at SMUS have their meals in Graves Hall, one of the most spectacular dining halls in all of Canada. You don’t need us to tell you that good food is important. And when you’re busy with school and your extracurricular activities, the last thing you will want to think about is “What’s for dinner?” Don’t worry – we have that covered with a nutritious, balanced diet.  As a boarding student, you will be served three balanced meals a day: breakfast, lunch and dinner, as well as snacks throughout the day. On Sundays, boarders get a special brunch (a late breakfast/early lunch). All meals are served in Graves Hall in the Sun Centre, which is just steps from your boarding house. 
    ""I like that if you want to be healthy, the dining hall has a lot of options. You can get so many fruits and yogurts and salads, and there's also a hot meal. Having so many choices, there’s always something to eat.""
    — Vivien from Shanghai, China  Learn more about dining at SMUS and find our current menu. At SMUS, we provide you with a lot of options at every meal. Whether you’re hungry for a fresh-made hot dish, or you just want a soup and salad from the salad bar, you know you’ll always get a healthy and filling meal. The menu changes every day and you will get an opportunity to experience cuisine from other countries during regular theme nights. You can also suggest your favourite food to our chefs, or join the Boarding Food Committee, and have a say about what should be on the menu. And while healthy eating is a big priority, we know how satisfying it is to sometimes nourish your soul with a tasty treat (like our popular Pizza Thursdays!) Celiac? Lactose intolerant? Allergic to certain foods? Don’t worry – we will accommodate your needs. Every meal has at least one vegetarian option, and if you have special dietary requirements or food allergies, let our chefs know in advance and they will prepare something especially for you. You’ll have access to snacks in the Sun Centre dining hall during recess and in the evening. You can use the kitchen facilities in your boarding house to store and prepare light snacks, like popcorn or a grilled cheese sandwich. Or why not grab a speciality coffee at the very popular The Howard Café in our Student Commons area? During free time, many boarders take the opportunity to visit the nearby coffee shops, cafés and restaurants. On the weekend, groups of boarders often head into downtown Victoria's enviable restaurant scene to have a meal with their friends.

     We are honoured to recognize members of the SMUS community as they retire and take on new adventures. Read the 2019 Retiree series to learn more about their outstanding contributions to the school. In this story, we recognize Janice Iverson, former Senior School receptionist. Anyone who entered School House at the Senior School campus can likely attest to the warm welcome they received from Janice Iverson. In 1999, Janice came on board at St. Michaels University School for part-time reception. During the first years, she also explored a few other areas including admissions and university counselling before settling into her role at reception. Sincere and warm, Janice set the tone and managed the needs of each person who entered the school. Before SMUS, Janice had worked in secretarial and administrative work, but she had never worked in education. What struck her was the “energy, variety and family-focus” of the SMUS environment. Drawn to the “community-based, flexible nature” of the school, Janice dedicated her time and energy here for the next 20 years. “I really enjoyed going to work. It was never dull or tedious,” she says. “I do miss it. It was great. I do hope to drop in for visits from time to time.” Some of the most profound changes during Janice’s time with the school were dramatic physical developments with the Crothall Centre for Arts and Humanities (2002), the John and Anne Schaffter Hall Music Centre (2004), the Monkman Athletic Complex (2008), the Sun Centre student commons and dining hall (2018). Witnessing and supporting the growth, both in structure and student capacity, of SMUS was significant for Janice. “The Sun Centre was a really big one for the students. It’s so beautiful.” “There are so many programs and SMUS goes beyond normal learning,” Janice shares. “There were also so many opportunities to contribute and do things. It was wonderful to have the chance to get to know other staff and faculty informally.” She loved pitching in with the Spring Fairs, Alumni Weekend and the International Markets. Of note was participating in the SMUS corporate rowing challenge and winning first place with her team, Ducks in a Row in 2016. Janice retired in 2018 but filled in on reception for several weeks during the summer of 2019. Moving forward, Janice will continue to paint abstracts in acrylic, hike and travel (upcoming trips include England, Scotland and Hawaii). Her Hawaii trip next year is with her 95-year-old mother, her agile, very bright “role model.” She also plans to “duck” into the school for a coffee now and again to maintain connection with her friends and the SMUS community.

     As our Grade 12 students look ahead to June and what path they will take after graduation, our University Counselling department is helping ensure students have as much information and as many experiences to make confident choices about their future. That's why 29 students travelled to southern Ontario this past weekend to visit 11 universities and get a feel for the campuses, learn about the programs, see the facilities and connect with SMUS alumni who study there. (You can watch a video recap on the trip at the bottom of this story.) ""We're all really glad this tour is back up and running again after COVID because we've seen year after year the value of a trip like this for our students,"" says Ruth McGhee, Director of University Counselling. ""Nothing compares to an in-person visit to know how far it is between buildings or how the food is or what the dorms look like. Those are important details. Our students can learn about programs and courses online, but this trip gives them a sense of what it's like on the ground experiencing the reality of campus life."" Traditionally, 15-20% of our graduating class any given year chooses to study at a university in southern Ontario. Getting to tour so many schools in eight different cities helps give students a more authentic feeling of what it would be like living and studying there. Historically, the Ontario trip has served as an invaluable tool for many – if not all – Grade 12 students who've participated either to reaffirm a chosen school, or to add a new school to (or remove one from) their list of schools they'll apply to. The students met up with a number of young alumni studying in Ontario who say their experience on the trip was instrumental in making their post-secondary choices. ""I look at 2019 alumni like Jerry Wong, Tuan Anh Vu and Mylena Mendes who went on this trip and said it really helped crystalize for them what their path could look like and what their experience on that path would be,"" Ruth says. In addition to Jerry, Tuan and Mylena, SMUS alumni at most of the schools shared their firsthand experiences at each school. ""Chatting with alumni provides an extra layer of connection knowing that that student has also been at SMUS and now they're at this particular university,"" Ruth says. ""It breaks down some of those barriers and allows them to lean into finding out what's it like to study there. 'Did SMUS prepare you well? How different is it from SMUS?' If our students can anchor it in really familiar experiences here and link it to their experiences there, they will be better equipped to choose a university.""

https://www.smus.ca/discover/our-school/indigenous-connections,"   One of our core values at St. Michaels University School is respect. With this in mind, we acknowledge that our school rests in the heart of Straits Salish territory, a living culture with its own rites, ceremonies, and unfolding history. We honour the Esquimalt, Songhees, and W̱SÁNEĆ peoples – whose homelands we share and whom we recognize as our neighbours. Begun in 2017 and explicitly backed with a commitment in our Floreat strategic plan to ""Honour Our Indigenous Connections"", the SMUS community has undertaken an intentional journey to build authentic and respectful relationships with local Indigenous Peoples. This has entailed deepening our understanding of the history behind our relationship and what it means to be on a path of reconciliation today.  Key to this journey since the outset has been a focus on relationships. We have sought guidance from First Nations elders who are respected within their communities and traditionally trained in the ways of their people. Much of the last few years has been spent laying this groundwork, particularly with the Coast Salish and Kwakwaka‘wakw communities on Vancouver Island. The eminent Coast Salish Elder Bill White, from the Snuneymuxw First Nation, joined us early on to be our First Nations Guide. Bill’s thoughtful and knowledgeable guidance has allowed us to move this journey forward. After drawing on conversations with members of our local traditional community, along with advice from diversity leaders and other independent schools, 10 interrelated strands were identified as central to our approach: We are making considerable progress along our path to becoming a more welcoming community, much of which can be read in the recent articles below.

     Every year, we are honoured to recognize members of the SMUS community as they retire and take on new adventures. Read the 2019 Retirees series to learn more about their outstanding contributions to the school. In this story, we recognize Mary Smith, former Middle School music teacher. Mary Smith taught strings at SMUS for 33 years. Credited for building a thriving string ensemble program and for inspiring many young musicians, Mary considers that it may have been her teaching style that contributed to success. It allowed for committed development. Additionally, it was the power of the music-making that supported the activity. “If there were students sitting around this table now” she says, “they would be nodding in agreement about one, or both, of these aspects.” She also credits Leonard Takoski, who was building the school’s orchestral program when she started at SMUS in 1986. He was a mentor whose secret to success in its inaugural years (1980s) was that all students in Grades 4 and 5 took part in string instrument study. That approach remains and many students benefit from playing during their Junior School years, gaining experience through several rich musical opportunities. At SMUS, strings students had a myriad of opportunities to perform in different configurations. From small ensembles to solos in chapel, as accompanists to choral presentations, as pit orchestra musicians for musicals at the McPherson Playhouse, they participate often in making music. The Junior School curriculum provides excellent foundational learning in rhythm, melody and harmony which primes learners effectively in their early years. At the Middle School students choose to study band or strings and sing in a choir. Mary cherished the “growing sense of commitment as they developed skills in musical expression through taking part in choral singing and strings simultaneously.” The process of delivering the strings curriculum remained consistent from year to year as Mary taught at the Junior and Middle School campuses. She used traditional learning methods that are time-tested and allow for logical, sequential progress. What did shift was the repertoire and what suggestions students brought. Also, Mary learned how to use Finale, a music notation software while on a leave of absence in Kuala Lumpur where her husband was working as an orchestra manager. This was a game changer as she could then compose études and studies for ensemble use at SMUS. For six years, Mary was the faculty representative on the SMUS Society Board of Governors. It was a “fabulous opportunity.” She enjoyed contributing and participating with a group that was active and task oriented, she says. “They steadily connect with the community and contribute whole-heartedly at the governance level.”
Mary’s two sons graduated from SMUS. Gregory ’01 is the Technical Director at the Belfry Theatre and Christopher ‘98 has now taken on the leadership of the Middle School strings program alongside his primary music teaching duties at the Junior School. Reflecting on her time at the school, Mary notes that over the years chapel services have changed a great deal. She tips her hat to the chaplain for speaking to the “grand diversity” of spiritual needs, contemplations and practices of students across the campus. She believes that chapel services provide essential gathering times. Other shifts she references are the integration of technology, the establishment and healthy development of the Learning Resource Centres and the dramatic growth in composition of the student body. Retirement provides a much different pace than teaching strings. Previously Mary was “always delivering” through moving and setting furniture, conducting, encouraging, composing, listening, focusing, enjoying, thinking and steadily planning. Now she participates in cycling, reading, embroidery projects and plays with the Victoria Chamber Orchestra, also designing its concert programs. Mary has been a member of this orchestra for 18 years and is currently its principal cellist. She is also preparing herself for volunteering as a performing musician for patients at the Royal Jubilee Hospital. “There is much to learn,” she says. As this year progresses, Mary looks forward to hearing the concerts of the students she nurtured. For the most part, however, she’s intent on not overscheduling herself. “I’m taking time to settle,” she beams. Last thoughts? She pauses. “It matters not how one comes to being involved in the world of music, there is always something to be gained and appreciated.”

     Grade 6 student Levi Budd this week won $10,000 for Habitat for Humanity Victoria in the organization's Meaning of Home contest. The Middle School student wrote a 300-word essay on what home means to him, and was named a runner up in the contest's Grade 6 category. ""It seemed like a really good contest to enter,"" says Levi. ""I thought it was really cool because it was a chance to help out the community. I thought it would be cool to win, but it's also cool that it's helping a charity in Victoria."" Levi and his classmates in Ms. Cara Lee's Humanities class all participated in the national Meaning of Home contest. For every entry submitted, $10 was donated to the local Habitat for Humanity. More than 13,000 students entered the national contest this year, raising a total of $311,000 to benefit Habitat for Humanity organizations across the country. The $10,000 prize that Levi won for the Victoria non-profit will help support the building of homes in Greater Victoria.  Habitat for Humanity says $10,000 will go a long way, as it can help pay for the purchase of doors and windows for a new home, flooring, or cabinetry in a kitchen and bathrooms. For Levi, home means safety and protection. ""For me, home is my safe haven,"" he wrote in his essay. ""Home is a place where everything is practically perfect in every way. I feel safe, and I feel loved."" He says that feeling he gets from being at home is one that he hopes the families who benefit from Habitat for Humanity and the $10,000 will also feel. “Our charity is so delighted to receive a $10,000 grant for our build fund! In essence, school children in Victoria are directly contributing to building homes in our community,"" says Tiffany Gates, Director of Family Services at Habitat for Humanity Victoria in a release announcing Levi's win. ""Special thanks to Levi, his classmates, and all of the Greater Victoria entrants.”  In addition to the donation, Levi won a pizza party for his Humanities class and a tablet for himself. Levi says that next year he hopes even more young people enter the contest. ""If you apply you might not win, but $10 still gets donated, he says, ""so even if you don't win you'll still be helping out a charity, and that's a really great thing!""

     I am told rowing is a unique sport that requires balance, coordination, power and endurance – all while facing backwards! Not only is it a great full-body workout, but the experience of being out on the water makes it truly special.  At SMUS, our rowing program is available to students from Grades 9-12. It is seasonal – with our fall rowing program being geared toward mostly novice rowers who compete primarily within Greater Victoria, and a spring rowing program that continues with the competitive program for the athletes who are keen on the sport, and show promise and commitment. This year, SMUS placed second overall in the City, with many of our athletes medalling throughout the competitive season, including taking home gold medals. We have 92 athletes participating in rowing this year and students attended many regattas, including Elk Lake, Maple Bay, Shawinigan Lake and Brentwood. We have a group of students now competing this weekend at the CSSRA national regatta at Royal Henley in St. Catharines, Ontario. SMUS competitive rowers train six days a week – sometimes twice a day! – for fitness and on the water. They also attend extended training camps during the Easter break and the Victoria Day holiday weekend. I met with our rowing coach, Susanne Walker Curry, to learn a little bit more about philanthropy and how our Annual Appeal supports these student athletes.  “Philanthropy is absolutely key to the success of the SMUS rowing program. Rowing is a costly sport that requires specialized equipment and training, travel and transportation,” she says. “The generosity of our ‘silent donors’ through the annual fund and the Parents’ Auxiliary has allowed our 10-year-old program to grow and thrive, and lets SMUS punch well above its weight in scope and athletic success”. Susanne goes on to say that “the results of our philanthropic angels are evident not just in the medals or results on the race course, but in the kinds of young men and women we develop at the school.” Rowing has been described as a “transformational” sport by many of the student athletes and their parents. “Through the program, we consciously work together to develop character and to allow our young people to discover the excellence within. We call on our young athletes to ‘get uncomfortable’ so that they can gain courage, discipline and insight,” Susanne adds. “The program creates a strong family atmosphere where students learn how to support one another and develop teamwork and loyalty. Through training and coaching, we watch our students’ athleticism grow but we also emphasize personal growth.” Susanne says there is no way this could happen without the generosity and kindness of our donors and supporters. This year the rowing program hopes to purchase a “heavy four”, with the cost of this boat being $30,000. As well, a new trailer is needed at a cost of $40,000. We hope to raise this $70,000 in our annual appeal in support of the SMUS Rowing program. The deadline to give is June 30.  You can donate online at www.smus.ca/giving or contact me at shara.campsall@smus.ca or 250-370-6197. We asked four students currently competing at the CSSRA Regatta (national competition) to explain what the rowing program means to them. Hannah Look (Victoria; Grade 9) says the rowing program gives her a “sense of home” at the school and has instilled a confidence that she carries into life outside of rowing. The busy training schedule has taught her to manage her time wisely. When Hannah wins a race or completes one successfully, she says she is overcome with a sense of shared camaraderie and accomplishment. Georg Mackenthun (Heidelberg, Germany; Grade 10) rowed at his previous school. He finds that the coaching here at SMUS differs because it focuses on each individual athlete and not just the team. Georg says this approach has a positive on him and feels it has led to greater success and self-confidence. The program provides a personal challenge, which in turn, encourages the athlete to learn more about themselves and to grow as a person. Nathan Yang (Newport Beach, USA; Grade 11) talks about the sense of family the rowing program brings. He was an athlete in other sports, like swimming, but did not feel this same special bond. This sense of belonging is important to him as a boarding student. Nathan says he is grateful to Coach Walker-Curry, as she pays attention to bringing these principles to the program.  Having a strong sense of teamwork and connection encourages and motivates him and his teammates to do their very best for themselves and each other. Olivia Meadows (Victoria; Grade 12) was thrilled to find both a sport and a group of people that she wholeheartedly loves. Rowing has helped her grow as an athlete and as a person, and has boosted her confidence and made her a better learner. Olivia has been challenged to step outside her comfort zone and to take initiative.

     Every year, we are honoured to recognize members of the SMUS community as they retire and take on new adventures. Read the 2019 Retirees series to learn more about their outstanding contributions to the school. In this story, we recognize Jennifer White, former executive assistant to the Head of School. Sometimes you get a call that changes everything. For Jennifer White, it was two phone calls within a couple of hours that led her to apply for the executive assistant to the Head of School job at SMUS - one call from a friend and another from a former SMUS employee who had both seen the job posting and immediately thought of her. Before SMUS, Jennifer worked in administration for businesses directly with CEOs, presidents and owners. Her previous job in administration was in engineering. When the business sold, she opted to take a break and work part-time at PISE (Pacific Institute for Sport Excellence) – and that was when the calls came. Although the skill set for her position was administrative, similar to her past jobs, the dynamic was dramatically different at SMUS. “It’s much more emotionally dynamic, more personal,” she says. When she was in engineering, the focus was on hydroelectric systems and software. At SMUS? Parents and kids. “You needed to be objective in conversations. It could be tricky,” she says. “But that was one of the things I appreciated most about the job.” In line with a focus on the personal, Jennifer speaks highly of the generosity, sacrifice and genuine care she witnessed with the teachers towards the students, colleagues with one another and the school with everyone. “It was at a level you would not imagine.” As Bob Snowden’s 22-year role as Head of School ended in 2017, Jennifer was at the helm with communications, conversations, celebrations and more. The transition process required a lot of extra time, energy and work. “It was very intense.” But for her, “to see Bob, this distinguished Head of School, out graciously and gracefully – to disengage him from everything he has been doing for 22 years, was a privilege.” Jennifer stayed at the school to work with the interim Head of School Andy Rodford. With countless calls and emails to Mark Turner’s office in England, she helped pave the way for a seamless transition so Mark could take up his role. Over the years, Jennifer’s favourite part of her time at SMUS was working with the Head of School. She reveled in watching and learning and gathering what was essential to them, what they noticed, what they needed. “I’ve always worked with exceptional and really interesting people,” she says. She was days away from a month-long foray to Ireland at the time of writing. And beyond? “Education has always been really important to me,” she says. Jennifer is considering several options which are close to her heart and with her retirement, now has time to pursue. “A lot piques my interest!”

     A question I am often asked by prospective parents going through the admissions process is, “What is the value-added of the Junior School?” This is an understandable question as families consider such an investment for their young children.   It is one of my favourite questions to answer, too, but the challenge is keeping my reply short and succinct.   While I could speak about our incredible teaching faculty, our athletics program, our arts and music opportunities, the extracurricular offerings or how students get to explore and create in the library and Imagination Lab, a more subtle differentiator is one that is not so easily described in a quick statement. It is the way we know each child. While this may be something that could be considered a common statement all schools would make, I would suggest the resources we have to support students, the many dedicated faculty and staff who interact with each child every day, the time that is available for teachers to plan, and the structures we have in place are exceptional. Knowing each child is what sets St. Michaels University School apart. I know the teachers and supports at our Middle and Senior Schools are just as connected to each student, providing care and attention that is second to none.  This has been evident as we have navigated the ongoing threat to in-class learning and various elements of instability over the past two years, yet have remained a joyful place of learning in a culture of excellence and have prioritized the focus on each child. With systems in place behind the scenes, each child is known, their progress monitored, sparks of interest ignited, bumps along the road discussed and celebrated, reassurance given, and growth acknowledged. There are so many caring and attentive eyes on each child ensuring that throughout each day they are seen, heard and known.  Several times during the year, we have meetings where every single Junior School child is discussed by many educators connected to their learning. We involve Learning Support, the homeroom teacher, input from our specialist teachers and the Junior School counsellor. Seated together, we examine evidence from classes and what we see throughout the day: How are they doing? Where might they need support? Where do they need to be challenged? Are they feeling connected socially? What are they feeling excited about? What are their strengths? Where are their stretches? We hold each child up and honour them individually and ask ourselves how they are being nurtured for their year at school and beyond.  That is the value-added.  Thank you to Grade 6 student Maho M. for her beautiful drawing of the Junior School atop this story.

     Long before a student finds herself sitting in a Crothall classroom, playing a violin in the Schaffter Hall strings room, or working in the Imagination Lab at the Junior School, she and her family would have done extensive research on SMUS. Before my current association with SMUS, I remember being swayed at a dinner party by friends who insisted I had to visit the Junior School and feel its charm and energy for myself. Being a person who likes to explore at her own pace, I opted for an Open House visit rather than an appointment. The energy and level of curiosity by the young students was on clear display and I was won over. My son, of course, initially wanted none of it then but before long and nine years later, he was thanking his teachers more profusely than his parents. I knew I had made the right choice. Our Fall Spark Open House is Friday, October 25 and again we're throwing our doors open at our Junior, Middle and Senior Schools so that other parents can have the same experience I did. While ostensibly Open House is for future families, we also want current parents who have a child moving into Grade 6 or Grade 9 next year to please consider visiting us during Open House to see what awaits them. As well, should you find yourself at a dinner party, perhaps there will be a guest or two ready to be swayed to look at SMUS. As we say, ""bring a friend!"" Here’s some of what is in store: For more information and to register, please visit the SMUS Fall Spark Open House webpage. You can be assured that a warm welcome awaits!

     On Monday, our Junior School came together to celebrate Diwali, with a beautiful celebration led by our young students and supported by our parent community. Students from Kindergarten to Grade 5 lit diyas, spoke about the importance of Diwali in the Indian culture, and shared with their schoolmates their favourite customs and traditions. Below, find more photos from the event, and read our students' favourite Diwali traditions. ""Our family decorates by making Rangoli out of colored rice or sand. They are beautiful, geometric designs."" – Lyndon and Victoria ""In our family we go to my grandmas and have fireworks and sparklers in the backyard."" – Kaia and Ahlia ""A pandit, who is like a priest, comes to our house to perform a ritual or prayer called a puja. They teach us about Diwali, we pray and put red ink on our foreheads. We also wash gold and silver coins in milk to bring wealth to the family."" – Kiara and Aanya ""For us it is all about the food and giving the food to the gods in order to bless the family."" – Rakshith ""In my family we eat a lot of special foods and treats. One of them is gulab jamun."" – Zara ""My mom invites lots of people over to visit and eat delicious food. My favorite is paneer."" – Beckham ""We always put up lights on our front deck and light candles on the mantle."" – Ashwin ""We invite a lot of family and friends over and we eat a lot and have lots of sweets."" – Harrison ""We dance a lot during Diwali and we practice at the temple."" – Ramana

     After weeks of practice and rehearsals, our youngest Junior School students excitedly took to the stage this week to perform in a beautiful and fun Primary Christmas Concert. The show featured our Kindergarten, Grade 1 and Grade 2 students, as they performed songs from ""A Charlie Brown Christmas,"" songs inspired by ""'Twas the Night Before Christmas,"" and well-known songs adapted to have a Christmas twist. Thank you to Junior School music teacher Christopher Smith for all of his work preparing the students for the concert, as well as French teacher Stephanie Geehan '95 for teaching the students ""Vive le Vent"" – a French version of ""Jingle Bells."" And a huge thank you to Junior School teacher Lindsey Ashton for recording the show to share with our families. We hope you enjoy watching it!

     Although today financial aid is expressed through a monetary donation, in the past many creative ways were employed to help ensure that deserving young people could attend our two founding schools, St. Michael’s School and University School. However, Michael Symons, grandson of SMS founder Kyrle Symons, recalls how in the early days of St. Michael’s School his grandfather struck an arrangement whereby a young man could attend through the donation of milk from his family farm. I can’t remember the dates, but I remember this story from my granddad and my father. It happened after the school had boarders, which occurred in 1918, but this may have happened possibly closer to the Depression. My granddad, Kyrle Symons, was contacted by a gentleman whose son was having difficulty in the public school system and was experiencing some bullying. Arrangements were made for the family to come to the school for an interview and to discuss how the school could help. It was obvious upon arrival that the family wasn’t well off, but they were delightful, down-to-earth people. The parents explained in more detail what the academic issues were and that they wanted a better chance for their son. Granddad was impressed with the young lad and the parents, so the discussion turned to tuition and boarding fees. The family lived out in the far reaches of Metchosin towards Sooke, and in those days it was a long drive to Oak Bay. It became obvious that the family did not have the funds necessary for the boy to enter the school, but Granddad saw something in him that was valuable and worthy of development. When asked what the family did for work they explained that they had a small farm with some chickens and some milk cows. When asked if they had extra milk they replied, ""Yes."" When asked if they thought it was enough to supply milk for the boarders and the family (12 people), again they replied, ""Yes."" Granddad put the proposition to them that if they supplied milk for the boarders (their son being a weekly boarder, one who would go home on weekends) the lad could attend the school. This agreement was reached on a handshake and thus the school had another new boy. February is Financial Aid February at St. Michaels University School. This month we turn to the importance of accessibility to the school through financial aid. Please join all the other SMUS community members, past and present, who have helped young people attend our school and enjoy a world-class education.
