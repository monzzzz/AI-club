# 🚀 YOLO (You Only Look Once) - Object Detection Project

### 🎯 **Objective:**
We are diving into the world of **Object Detection** with the powerful **YOLOv8** model! Over the next few weeks, you'll learn how to:
- 📦 **Prepare data**
- 🏋️‍♂️ **Train the YOLOv8 model**
- 👁️‍🗨️ **Run object detection** and see it in action

### 📅 **Plan**

#### Week 1: Introduction to YOLOv8
- We'll kick things off by exploring **YOLOv8**, a cutting-edge object detection model that can identify multiple objects in a single glance—fast and accurate! 💥
- I'll give a brief overview of how YOLOv8 works, its importance, and where it’s used (hint: self-driving cars, surveillance, cool AI stuff!).
- **Project Overview**: I'll present the plan for this project, including what we’ll achieve and the time breakdown for each part.

📝 **Homework (Week 1)**:
1. Choose an **interesting object** that you’d like to detect using YOLO. It could be anything—cats, drones, cups, sports equipment—get creative! 🦄
2. **Gather about 200 images** of that object (from Google, phones, or any other source) so that we can train the model. Make sure these images show the object in different environments and angles. 📸

#### Week 2: Image Labeling with Roboflow
- I'll introduce you to **Roboflow** (https://roboflow.com), an awesome platform that makes data labeling easy and fun! 🎉
- We’ll learn how to upload your 200 images and start labeling the object you chose—this is how YOLO learns to recognize things. 🏷️

📝 **Homework (Week 2)**:
1. **Label your images** using Roboflow, ensuring accuracy. The better the labels, the smarter YOLO gets! 🧠

#### Week 3: Data Augmentation & Model Training
- This week is all about **augmenting** your dataset to make the model even better. Using Roboflow, we’ll apply techniques like flipping, rotating, and adjusting brightness to make the model more robust. 🔄
- Once the images are ready, you’ll export them and upload them to **Google Colab** for training.
- We’ll then **train YOLOv8** on your dataset, following the usage examples from [Ultralytics YOLO Docs](https://docs.ultralytics.com/modes/train/#usage-examples). Time to watch your model in action! 🖥️🔥

### 🎉 **FINISH!**
By the end of the project, you’ll have a trained YOLOv10 model that can detect your chosen object! 🚀 Get ready to blow minds with your object detection skills. 😎

💡 **Reminder:** Keep up with the homework each week to ensure you’re prepared for the next step. Let’s build something amazing together!
