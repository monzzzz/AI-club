5,"St. Michaels University SchoolFamily Handbook 2024-25  |  1ST. MICHAELS UNIVERSITY SCHOOL (SMUS) sets high 
standards for its staff and students  . We offer a very active, 
enjoyable and rewarding life for those who appreciate the 
opportunity to stretch themselves academically, artistically, 
athletically and culturally  . A great deal of personal freedom 
and responsibility abounds, which satisfies the needs of our 
developing leaders of the future  . Being part of such a dynamic 
and successful institution is a privilege, and we expect everyone 
to contribute positively to the school  .
The school does not have a long list of rules, regulations or 
restrictions  . Our underlying philosophy is one that will develop 
courteous, responsible and caring young adults  . A basic rule 
of good manners is to never make personal remarks, unless 
complimentary, about other people  . Having gone through 
a door, students should look behind and hold the door if 
someone is following  . On meeting adults in a doorway or a 
staircase, it is customary for a student to step aside and allow 
the adults to pass  . On noticing visitors to the school, students 
are expected to ask if they need help and to take them to the 
appropriate place or person .
St . Michaels University School is not for those who need the 
security of rules backed by harsh sanctions or those who need 
discipline  . We expect our students to treat others as they 
would wish to be treated, to do nothing against the dictates of 
conscience and good sense, and to act at all times in a way that 
will do credit to themselves and the good name and reputation 
of the school  .Our Mission
Our school seeks the excellence in all of us, with passion and 
compassion . We are a community shaped by the pursuit of truth 
and goodness, providing outstanding preparation for life  .
Our Vision
To learn, to lead, to serve  .
Our Values
Respect | Courage | Honesty | Service
Indigenous Recognition Statement
One of the four Values of St . Michaels University School is 
respect . With this in mind, we acknowledge that our school 
rests in the heart of Straits Salish territory, a living culture with 
its own rites, ceremonies and unfolding history  . We honour the 
Esquimalt, Songhees and W _ SÁNEĆ peoples, whose homelands 
we share and whom we recognize as our neighbours  .

10,"St. Michaels University SchoolFamily Handbook 2024-25  |  6Respecting Our Neighbours
Teaching students to respect the rights of others is a SMUS 
objective  . We ask students to be mindful of the privacy and 
rights of neighbours who live close to the school grounds  . We 
also expect parents to model this behaviour for their children . In 
this way, we can maintain amicable relationships with our local 
community  .
Like most schools, SMUS generates large volumes of non-
resident traffic that can adversely impact local residents in many 
ways, especially at peak times such as pick-up and drop-off  .
When you are dropping off or picking up your child, you must 
obey local bylaws and provincial traffic laws  . Violations of the 
following traffic laws and bylaws can be ticketed:
• Do not park closer than one metre from the edge of  
a residential driveway  .
• Do not park in neighbours’ driveways, even for very  
short periods  .
• Do not make U-turns, three-point turns, or use driveways 
to turn around during pick-up and drop-off when it 
interferes with the flow and access of other traffic  .
• Do not idle your car engine while you are stopped at a curb  .
• Do not exceed the posted speed limit and, when traffic is 
heavy or conditions are wet or icy, please drive slower than 
the posted speed limit .
• Do not stop or park where curbs are painted yellow  .
Do your part to minimize the impact of vehicles on our 
neighbourhood:
• Use alternative modes of transportation such as walking, 
cycling, and school or city buses  .
• If you are walking, use sidewalks wherever they are available  .
• If you are driving, park further away from the school and 
enjoy the walk  .
• Plan your route so that you can avoid making unsafe 
reverses and U-turns  .
Respect our neighbours’ privacy and property:
• Do not allow your children to run on lawns or play on 
swings in front yards  .
• Students using public transit near the school shall not 
loiter on lawns, be excessively noisy or litter near the bus 
stations  .Bicycles and Skateboards
On arrival at school, students, staff and visitors must lock their 
bicycles in the racks provided  . The law requires helmets for all 
SMUS students riding bicycles  . Boarding students must keep 
their bicycles locked in the appropriate storage area . SMUS takes 
no responsibility for loss or damage  .
Students using skateboards, scooters or other transportation 
‘vehicles’ are also required to wear safety equipment .
School Bus
If you plan to ride the school bus this year, you are 
required to fill out the school bus registration.  
https://forms  .gle/azm9JvEZjqMY5Us67  
The school offers morning and afternoon school bus pick-
up and drop-off daily, starting Thursday, September 5 . The 
routes are provided for your convenience at a very reasonable 
cost and cover a wide range of areas, from Langford to North 
Saanich and points in between . Students can ride the bus 
using their student cards, which are scanned each time they 
board the bus  . The cost for each ride is then automatically 
charged to their student account .
You may access our up-to-date bus information, including 
schedule, route and pricing information, at smus  .ca/campus-
services/bus-transportation . We try to accommodate all of our 
ridership, so changes in the route structure may be made during 
the summer, according to demand  . If you have routes you 
would like us to consider or if you have questions or comments, 
please contact our transportation department at 250-370-6150, 
or email jody  .bright@smus  .ca .

Our Learning Approach
St . Michaels University School offers an academic program that 
is demanding, stimulating and engaging  . It challenges students 
intellectually and encourages them to reach their full academic 
potential as it provides them with rich learning experiences in a 
wide variety of subject areas  .
The SMUS JK-12 program is an intentionally designed journey 
where meeting the personal needs of each individual learner 
is paramount . The objective at each level of education in 
the school is to strengthen foundational skills in literacy and 
numeracy, and foster creativity, critical thinking skills, and 
personal and social responsibility through inquiry and project-
based learning  .
Our academic program strives to combine relevant knowledge, 
steadfast rigour and a love of learning  .
The Portrait of a Learner
Throughout the learning experience at SMUS, we embed 
the seven characteristics of our Portrait of a Learner: curiosity, 
resilience, integrity, initiative, collaboration, empathy and well-
being . These characteristics are reflected upon throughout 
the learning process, in chapel, in community time and are 
connected with in a variety of demonstrations of learning  . Our 
goal is to foster these characteristics in our learners so that they 
are well set up for success in life beyond SMUS .
Highlights of the BC Curriculum within the  
SMUS Academic Context
• An Individualized Learning Environment: Our 
program inspires an individualized, student-centered 
approach that addresses the diverse needs and interests of 
our students
• Core Competencies: Learning experiences are designed 
with a focus on literacy and numeracy foundations 
support the development of students as critical thinkers 
and effective communicators who are personally and 
socially competent in all areas of their lives  .
• Interdisciplinary Learning Opportunities: The 
curriculum offers flexibility for cross-discipline learning 
experiences that are project-based and focused on skill 
development .
• Flexible Learning Environments: Our teachers embrace 
flexibility in creating learning environments that are 
relevant, engaging and responsive  .
• Indigenous Knowledge and Perspectives: Indigenous 
culture and perspectives are intentionally integrated 
throughout all areas of learning  . For example, place-based 
learning, an emphasis on Indigenous ways of knowing 
reflecting the First Peoples Principles of Learning, and 
Indigenous resources and community connections are 
thoughtfully embedded into the curriculum .Assessment Philosophy at SMUS
The Ministry of Education organizes courses around common 
learning standards  . At SMUS, our curriculum, pedagogy, 
assessment and reporting are all centred around these learning 
standards  . The standards make it clear what every student is 
expected to know, understand and be able to do  .
• Assessment practices are age and stage appropriate and 
allow students to demonstrate their learning in a variety 
of different ways  . From Kindergarten to Grade 8, feedback 
about learning is provided using proficiency indicators 
in relation to learning standards  . Percentage grades, in 
addition to proficiency indicators, begin in Grade 9 in the 
Senior School  . Some assignments and assessments may 
be formative and will not include any specific achievement 
score but they provide great value in helping students and 
teachers guide further learning  .
• Learners strive for improved performance over time across 
all grades  . In the Senior School, term results reflect the 
most recent evaluation in the learning process  .
• Feedback on learning is timely and ongoing, in addition to 
parent-student-teacher conferences  .
• For more detailed assessment information, please contact 
the appropriate Assistant Director at each division .
Communication of Student Learning
Our goal is to provide parents with timely and consistent 
feedback on learning that is easily understood  .
Parents can expect to receive written descriptive feedback in a 
formal report throughout the year, which includes proficiency 
and percentage grades (9-12) . Parents will also be able to read 
through student self-assessment of the Portrait of a Learner 
characteristics and goal setting on the formal reports and 
in various learning tasks  . Further, parents will be invited to 
demonstrations of learning and student-led conferences in the 
Junior and Middle schools  .
For any questions around communication of student learning, 
please contact the appropriate Assistant Director at each division ."
12,"St. Michaels University SchoolFamily Handbook 2024-25  |  8Learning Resource
At SMUS, if students have been identified as needing additional 
resources, we offer an excellent learning resource program at 
all three campuses  . The learning resource program consists of 
educators – most of whom have master’s degrees specializing 
in Special Education – with specific training in areas of 
remediation, enrichment, collaboration, educational coaching 
and assistive technology  . We work closely with families, 
teachers and directors to provide support for the students in 
our program . We strive to meet the needs of all our learners by 
offering the following:
• programming and accommodations for students with 
Individual Education Plans (IEPs)
• collaboration with teachers in the areas of curriculum, 
assessment, adaptations, differentiation and learning 
strategies
• training in, and access to, assistive technology• an effective balance between remediation and in-class 
assistance (Junior and Middle Schools), with an increased 
focus on compensatory strategies and self-advocacy as 
students progress through the school
• a focus on school-wide outreach, including a wide  
range of Middle and Senior School seminars on  
learning strategies, and supports for learning and 
organizational skills
• close collaboration with teachers, administrators, 
counsellors and psychologists to support students 
with academics, executive functioning, and social and 
emotional well-being
• assistance during key transitions: Junior School to Middle 
School, Middle School to Senior School, and Senior School 
to post-secondary
Social and Emotional Wellness
St . Michaels University School supports the social and emotional 
well-being of students through a variety of programs that 
address harassment, mean behaviour, social cruelty and bullying, 
while promoting ethical behaviour and our school Values of 
respect, courage, honesty and service  . The school’s Social and 
Emotional Development policy can be found on the Links for 
Current Parents section of our website  .
Equity, Diversity and Inclusion
We are committed to establishing a safe, inclusive, and equitable 
learning environment for all members of the community, 
including those who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, 
transgender, intersex, queer, two-spirit, and those who may be 
questioning their sexual orientation and/or gender identity  .
St. Michaels University School defines Equity, Diversity and Inclusion 
(EDI) in the broadest sense, including but not limited to sexual 
orientation, gender, gender identity, ability, appearance, ethnicity, 
culture, race, beliefs, and socio-economic background. In addressing 
equity, diversity and inclusion at SMUS, we are guided by our core 
Values: respect, courage, honesty, and service.Chapel
If chapel didn’t exist at the school, we would need to invent 
it . Every community that strives to be intentional in its work 
requires a time and place to gather as a whole  . Especially in the 
context of cultural, economic and geographical diversity, we 
need regular reminders of our common aspirations and foibles, 
along with the Values that hold us together  . Each time we give 
these ideas voice through a wisdom story, a nuanced question 
or a student reflection, we further strengthen our ability to 
discover our individual and collective promise – which is exactly 
what chapel is about .
The program mirrors the students who attend our school, 
some of whom are devout, some of whom identify with faith 
communities but aren’t active, and some of whom are non-
religious  . Our approach does not centre on a single world view 
or tradition . Rather, we base our gatherings on Values that are 
true to the school’s aspirations and upheld within most cultures: 
respect, courage, honesty and service  . While chapel at the Junior 
School is largely driven by staff, more than half of the Senior 
School gatherings are led entirely by students  . Everyone attends 
chapel once a week, with additional gatherings for boarders 
being held twice a month .
Our school overflows with the stuff of life: academic, artistic and 
physical opportunities  . In the midst of all this activity, chapel 
offers an intentional pause, encouraging our community to 
consider what a meaningful life entails  ."

teachers provide instruction in other areas of learning  .
Drop-Off, Dismissal and Pick-Up
We ask that all parents/guardians read the section titled 
“Respecting Our Neighbours” on page 6 of this handbook, 
as the Junior School drop-off and pick-up area is on a road in a 
residential neighbourhood  .
At morning drop-off and afternoon pick-up times, duty teachers 
supervise this process to ensure student safety  . Families can 
park and walk with their children onto campus, or older children 
can come onto campus independently  . If there is space in the 
“loading zone” in front of the school, parents can drop off their 
child (Kindergarten to Grade 5) . If you are using the loading zone 
between 8:00 - 8:30 or after school, do not leave your vehicle 
unattended and follow the rules of the road  .
All children traveling to and from school should use the 
crosswalk in front of the Junior School  . Due to safety concerns, 
children and parents/guardians are asked to not cross the street 
in other areas  .
Morning Routine
• All Kindergarten to Grade 5 children are expected to arrive 
at school in time for the 8:15 bell  . Junior Kindergarten 
children arrive by 9:00 . This allows us to start our day 
peacefully together without interruptions  .
• All Kindergarten to Grade 5 children enter the school 
through the side gate anytime between 8:00 and 8:15 .  
A duty teacher is outside before school and children are 
supervised  . The school day begins at 8:20 so we expect all 
children to arrive by 8:15 .
• Junior Kindergarten children arrive through the front door 
between 8:15 and 9:00 .  After-School Routine
• Classes are dismissed at 3:10 pm .
• At dismissal time, parents/guardians come onto campus 
through the side gate  .
• Students must exit through the side gate with their parent/
guardian so that they are seen by the gate duty teacher  .
• Children are not able to leave the school with anyone 
other than a person authorized by the family
• Children should be picked up between 3:10 pm and 3:20 pm .
• A bell sounds at 3:20 pm when the bus arrives  .
• Students are not permitted to exit through the front doors 
except when they are signing out during the school day or 
if they are leaving school after the gates have been locked  .
• Families are encouraged to make their after-school 
arrangements (sports, clubs, play dates, etc  .) in advance, as 
students may only use the phone during the school day if 
an urgent issue arises  .
Transportation
• Students who travel to school by the SMUS bus are given 
a student card that the bus driver scans each time the 
student boards the bus  . Cards can also be used in the 
Campus Shop  . For complete details regarding buses, 
please visit smus  .ca/campus-services/bus-transportation .
Parent/Guardian Pick-Up
• Students must tell their teacher each morning how they will be 
getting home that afternoon: taking the bus, or in the regular 
pick-up lane, or attending the After-School Care Program . It is 
important that the after-school plan is communicated to the 
teacher at the beginning of the day because it is sent with 
the attendance form and recorded in the school office  .
After-School Routine – Junior Kindergarten
• A parent or designated adult must come to the classroom to 
pick up their Junior Kindergarten child between 2:00 - 3:00 .  
Children are not able to leave the school with anyone, other 
than a person authorized by the family on the forms  .
After-School Program
The After-School Care Program is a welcoming, diverse and 
inclusive drop-in program that offers care to Kindergarten to 
Grade 5 students between 3:15 and 5:30 pm . SMUS is committed 
to ensuring all Health Authority Licensing requirements are 
followed, including child ratios  . All facilities used are licensed by 
Island Health and inspected by the health authority’s licensing 
officer on a regular basis  . Parents/guardians can contact the Junior 
School office when their child needs After-School Care services  .
Junior School Information
The Junior School information package is available on the SMUS 
Website on the Current Parents page  ."
18,"St. Michaels University SchoolFamily Handbook 2024-25  |  14Absences and Lateness
We expect all students arrive by 8:15 . If a student arrives late, 
they must report to the school office or use the sign-in/sign-out 
sheet located there  .
Parents/guardians are asked to phone 250-598-3922 or email  
christine  .shewchuk@smus  .ca before 8 am if your child is  
going to be late or absent on a school day  . If students are  
late, you must sign your child in at the office on arrival  .
Parent/Guardian Visitors and Student 
Sign-In/Sign-Out
All parents/guardians visiting the school during the school day 
are asked to sign in at the office for security purposes  . If your 
child arrives late or is picked up early for an appointment, you 
must sign them in or out in the binder at the office door  .
Parents/Guardians as Partners
Parents/guardians play an important role at our school, 
especially in the Junior School, as you are viewed as partners 
in your child’s educational journey  . You are invited to attend 
regularly scheduled meetings such as the Curriculum Evening 
and Parent/Guardian-Teacher Conferences  . You are also invited 
to attend Monday morning chapel, be present at special events 
during the year, and volunteer in the Junior School community  . 
We encourage you to communicate regularly with your child’s 
teacher  . You are most welcome in the Junior School  .
Adult Volunteers
The Junior School environment is enriched by the many 
parents/guardians who share their time and talents  . Many 
opportunities are available for you to become involved at the 
Junior School on a formal or informal basis  . Working in the 
Library Learning Commons, accompanying classes on trips, 
giving career talks, and serving as a grade representative or on 
the welcome committee are some of the ways in which you can 
contribute to the school and gain satisfaction and enjoyment 
from working with the children .
Requests for Additional Leave From School
The school’s school dates are published in advance and it 
is our expectation that families book travel during school 
holidays to limit disruption to learning and school life  . If an 
extended absence from school is required, a request should be 
made to the Director of the Junior School in advance  . School 
work will not be provided for students to do while absent, as 
curriculum is taught in an immersive way with instruction, 
class engagement and process time  . Teachers may have 
suggestions for independent learning while the child is away 
but this will not be assessed  .First Aid Room
The Junior School has a small, basic supply of first-aid products, 
sufficient to take care of minor scrapes, cuts, aches and pains  . 
Medication is administered with written permission only  . If 
children do not feel well during the school day, they can rest in 
the first aid room, and we will call you to come pick up your child  .
Allergy Aware School
There are many students with severe allergies and therefore 
the Junior School provides an allergy aware environment for 
students with life-threatening allergies  . Specific information will 
be communicated as needed to ensure the safety of all students  .
Cellphones
Students at the Junior School are not permitted to carry  
cellphones or wear smartwatches  .
Communication of Student Learning
Effective communication between home and school is essential 
for student success  . We provide and maintain ongoing, regular 
communication about your child’s progress  . In order to do 
this most effectively, we have scheduled numerous meetings, 
reports and other communications with parents/guardians 
through the school year  . In addition, teachers are available to 
meet with parents/guardians at any time  .
September: Junior School Curriculum Evening
October: Personal communication for new students
November: Parent/Guardian-Teacher Conferences
December: Formal written report
February: Ongoing sharing of Learning
March: Parent/Guardian-Teacher Conferences
May:  Student Demonstrations of Learning
June: Formal written report"
19,"St. Michaels University SchoolFamily Handbook 2024-25  |  15Student Agendas
All students in Grades 1-5 are given a student agenda for use 
throughout the school year  . The agenda is to go between home 
and school and is a useful tool for helping students with their 
homework organization and communication . Parents/guardians 
are encouraged to check this agenda regularly for notes from 
school  .
Home Learning Policy
The Junior School teachers promote the practice of a reasonable 
amount of daily home learning on Monday to Thursday 
evenings  . Home learning will not be assigned on the weekend 
or during school holidays  . Children are encouraged to read, 
practise their instruments, and complete some type of other 
homework as assigned by teacher  . As a general guideline, 
children receive 10 minutes of homework per grade (for 
example, Grade 2 students would have about 20 minutes 
of learning that includes reading and another task) . Junior 
School teachers believe that family time in the evenings and 
on weekends is a priority  . A good balance of work and play is 
always encouraged  .Extracurricular Clubs, Activities and Sports
A variety of clubs, activities, and sports is offered throughout the 
year on a term by term basis  . The office sends out information 
regarding what is being offered and how to sign up at the 
beginning of each term . More information on extracurricular 
offerings is available on the school’s website  ."

Welcome
On behalf of the staff at the Middle School, we welcome students 
and parents to the 2024-25 school year  . We also extend a special 
welcome to all students who are either new to SMUS or who are 
transitioning from the Junior School  . We are committed to working 
with you and your child to make this a successful school year  .
School Values
We set high standards for staff and students, and we expect 
everyone to contribute positively to the school  . The school 
Values of respect, courage, honesty and service guide our 
expectations for student behaviour and are at the heart of all 
discussions and support .
Behaviour and Discipline
When students make a mistake, we strive to help them align with 
our Values, which are the basis of all discipline discussions  . The 
school believes in helping to change thoughtless or irresponsible 
behaviour with guidance and support . However, in cases where 
warnings are not heeded or where there has been a serious 
breach of school rules, students may be suspended or expelled  .Peer Conflict, Mean Behaviour and Bullying
The school has a comprehensive policy, “Supporting the Social 
and Emotional Development of our Students,” that details our 
response to situations involving peer conflict, mean behaviour, 
and bullying  . The school’s Social and Emotional Development 
policy can be found on the Links for Current Parents section of 
our website  .
While conflict is considered a normal part of peer interaction 
and a student’s academic discourse, SMUS views conflict that 
includes mean behaviour or bullying as unacceptable and will 
respond accordingly  .
As each situation is unique, the school has a variety of responses 
that it uses to help resolve conflicts  . These responses seek to 
rebuild relationships first; only if a situation warrants it is a more 
punitive approach considered  .
School Y ear Start-Up
The new school year begins on Wednesday, September 4 for all 
Grade 6 students, and for all new Grade 7 and 8 students  . This 
is an orientation day that is led by Grade 8 WEB Leaders (Where 
Everybody Belongs) that will help welcome students to Middle 
School  .
Returning students begin school on Thursday, September 5 .
For further information on events at the beginning of the school 
year, please refer to the details in the SMUS Calendar at

23,"St. Michaels University SchoolFamily Handbook 2024-25  |  19Drop-Off and Pick-Up
Traffic becomes congested at the Richmond Road campus 
during peak drop-off and pick-up times for Middle and Senior 
School students  . Two entrances to campus exist: one on McRae 
Avenue and one on Knight Avenue  . We encourage Middle 
School parents to consider arriving from Knight Avenue and, 
keeping right, travel around the Monkman Athletic Complex . 
Please avoid stopping in the middle of the roadway or driveway, 
as this impedes traffic flow  . We also encourage parents to drop 
off on Knight Avenue with children walking through the campus 
to the Middle School  .
Absences and Lateness
Parents are asked to call the Middle School office at 
250-592-3549 or email at tara .toller@smus  .ca before 8:20 am if 
your child is going to be absent or late that day  . Students must 
report to the main office on arrival so that we can maintain 
accurate records  . Students who are medically absent for more 
than five consecutive school days must submit a doctor’s note 
on their first day back to school  .
Family Holidays
School holidays are generous, and we appreciate adherence 
to the specified dates  . Families must request holiday 
extensions in writing and submit them to the Director of 
Middle School well in advance.
Timetables
Students will receive their timetable on the first day of school  . A 
good deal of thought is given to class formation . Students are 
grouped in a variety of ways throughout the school day  . Many 
different timetabling factors are at play when assigning students 
to classes  . At the Middle School, a parent request for a specific 
teacher or class is difficult to accommodate and limits our ability 
to build balanced classes in which the needs of all students are 
considered  .
We reserve the right to make the final decision with respect to 
class placement . Unless there is a serious conflict that merits 
consideration for a change, please trust our judgment .
Smartphones
We are committed to developing and expecting a high level of 
digital citizenship from all students  . At the Middle School, we 
do not support cellphone use during the day  . Our goal is for 
students to learn to use technology appropriately and avoid 
the use of technology in ways that negatively impact learning, 
socialization, health and safety  . Cellphones, for Middle School 
students, undermine focus and productivity  . If families allow 
students to bring a cellphone to school, these phones are not 
to be used on school property until after 5:30 pm . There are 
situations that require flexibility that will be considered on an 
individual basis  . We have a telephone for student use  .Charges to Student Accounts
Students may charge items, such as purchases from the Campus 
Shop, to their student accounts  . Student cards are scanned 
for day students who eat in Graves Hall, and meal charges are 
invoiced monthly to the student’s account . Students are not 
allowed to use their student card to charge meals for other 
people  . If a student needs a replacement student card, there is a 
charge of $5 .
Occasionally, we require that students have certain consumable 
items such as math exercise books, music books, or science 
workbooks, which are billed to student accounts  . Generally, the 
cost of school activities, including most sports and field trips, 
are included as part of student fees  . If there is an additional fee 
involved, we notify you as part of the activity or trip information 
sent home  . Some sports and activities, such as rowing and any 
overnight trips, have some type of fee to help offset the costs  .
Outdoor education trips are generally excluded from additional 
fees; however, some outtrips have a fee due to transportation 
and other costs associated with that activity  .
Communication of Student Learning 
Effective communication between home and school is essential 
for student success  . We provide and maintain ongoing, regular 
communication about your child’s progress  . In order to do this 
most effectively, we have scheduled numerous meetings with 
parents/guardians and reports through the school year  .

Teacher Advisor Group (TAG)
Each student is assigned to a Teacher Advisor Group  . Grouping 
students in this way is consistent with good middle-year 
practice and provides students with the consistency and 
structure that enhances their learning  . The Teacher Advisor 
plays a critical role in your child’s life at the school  . They are 
responsible for the overall well-being of each student in their 
TAG . The TAG teacher is a good first point of contact in the 
school for questions related to student life  ."
24,"St. Michaels University SchoolFamily Handbook 2024-25  |  20Homework Purpose and Policy
The purpose of homework at the Middle School level, based in 
current research, is threefold: to reinforce learning, to practise 
skills and develop academic habits of mind, and to deepen 
understanding  . Assignments and home study are an integral part 
of the academic program at SMUS, and Middle School teachers 
promote the practice of a reasonable amount of daily homework  .
A guiding principle for teachers and for students should be: up 
to 60 minutes in Grade 6, up to 70 minutes in Grade 7 and up 
to 80 minutes in Grade 8 per evening for homework  . Students 
are encouraged to read and/or practise their instruments on a 
regular basis as part of this homework routine  . If you feel your 
child has too much homework on a regular basis, it is important 
that you notify your child’s TAG teacher, so that we can best 
support your child to balance their school commitments with 
those outside of school and free time  . Homework will not 
be assigned over long weekends or school holidays  . A good 
balance of work and play is always encouraged  .
Student Agenda
To assist students in organizing their study time and materials, 
each student is given a Middle School agenda . Students are 
expected to use their agenda on a daily basis; tasks, reminders, 
due dates and homework assigned by subject teachers should 
be entered after each class  . The agenda can also further 
communication between school staff and parents; it contains 
useful information for students and parents about the Middle 
School  . If used properly, the agenda can be an invaluable asset 
for the student . We encourage parents to engage in discussions 
with your child about the agenda as a tool for organization and 
learning, and to check-in regularly regarding their agenda usage  .
SMUS Student Email Use Policy
Students are expected to use their SMUS email only for school-
related communications and activities  . The circulation of non-
academic content is not permitted as this activity is distracting 
and interferes with the teaching and learning for both students 
and teachers  . We support students to develop a sense of pride 
and accountability related to their communications and to help 
them to understand the difference between personal and school 
communication . Gmail, chat, etc  . are also not permitted at school  . 
With parent permission, we encourage students to create a 
personal email account to use for personal exchanges  .Homework Club
The Middle School library is usually open after school until 4 pm, 
Monday to Thursday  . Students are welcome to use this facility to 
complete homework, receive assistance or conduct research .
Lockers
Each student is loaned a book locker and a physical education 
locker for the year  . Students are responsible for taking care of 
their lockers  . Lockers must have locks  . Students may bring their 
own combination locks or have one charged to their student 
account .
Executive Functioning and Library
The Middle School provides its students with an executive 
functioning and library skills curriculum . Executive functioning 
skills are taught as part of the Humanities program in Grade 6 
and 7 . Library skills are taught in Grades 6 to 8 and focus on 
research, study and research skills  . These skills are taught 
collaboratively by subject teachers, the teacher-librarian and 
learning resource specialists  . (Students who are new to the 
Middle School in Grade 7 and 8 are offered a condensed version 
of this curriculum early in the school year  .)
Music
A charge of approximately $35 covers the purchase of music, 
method books and a folder with the student’s name and 
instrument engraved on it . This initial charge is reduced in 
subsequent years when folder purchase is not required  . Band 
students who do not own an instrument should rent or purchase 
one from a music store in September  . In some cases, the school 
can lend an instrument . Information about instrument rental and 
purchase is made available in September  .
Outdoor Education
Outdoor education trips and activities are offered throughout 
the school year to Middle School students  . Please see the 
online calendar for specific dates  . Optional activities like a ski/
snowboard day are also offered, depending on the season ."
25,"St. Michaels University SchoolFamily Handbook 2024-25  |  21Co-curricular Athletic Program
The Middle School belongs to the Lower Island Middle School 
Sports Association (LIMSSA) . This association was formed in 
2003 to create athletic opportunities for middle schools in 
Victoria, Saanich and Sooke  . With the reconfiguration of the 
Victoria School District from elementary to middle schools, it 
was crucial that an association be created specifically aimed at 
the Grade 6-8 levels to encourage athletic participation among 
those member schools  .
The purpose/philosophy of LIMSSA is:
• to encourage athletics among the schools within the 
confines of the association and to maintain a high level  
of participation, sportsmanship and citizenship;
• to legislate and to adopt uniform participation, regulations, 
schedules, tournaments and special events for all school 
sports – these shall provide for qualification of all players, 
teams and coaches, and the rules and regulations of all 
activities in which the association sponsors or approves;
• to honour the code of desirable practices as set down by 
the LIMSSA Code of Ethics  .
We anticipate being able to offer the following sports this 
school year: badminton, basketball, cross country, field hockey, 
rugby, sailing, soccer, squash, swimming, touch rugby, track 
and field, and volleyball  .
When possible, coaches are given the same practice day(s) 
during the week  . However, because we share facilities with 
the Senior School, this is not always feasible  . Practice time is 
generally after school but, for some teams, it may also occur 
during the cross-grade physical education classes  . Occasionally, 
a team may practise in the morning before school starts  .
A sports schedule is posted each week outside the Physical 
Education office, on the student notice board, and a copy is also 
left in the office  . It is also emailed home to parents every Friday  . 
We encourage students and parents to check the schedule 
regularly for practice and game times  .
Some teams will be issued a uniform for their playing season . It 
is the player’s responsibility to maintain their uniform and return 
it to the coach at the end of the season . Physical education strip 
will be used for practices or, in the case of the rugby teams, the 
students may wear the school rugby jersey and black shorts  .
A jamboree, festival, tournament and/or playoff usually takes 
place at the end of the sporting season . This format can 
involve either a half day or full day where schools are invited to 
participate  . If it is a playoff, games will often occur after school 
over a period of several days  .
With our main emphasis on participation, skill building, 
sportsmanship, citizenship and a qualified coaching staff, we strive 
to provide a positive athletic experience at the Middle School  .Clubs and Councils
Typically, a variety of clubs and activities are offered throughout 
the year  . In past years some of the activities we have offered 
include: Art Club, Model United Nations, Robotics and Jazz Band  . 
All students are encouraged to join one of the five Leadership 
Councils: Arts, Athletics, Service, Social and Sustainability  . New 
clubs and activities are usually offered each year, depending on 
student interest and staff availability  . Information about these 
clubs and activities is usually posted on the bulletin board  
across from the main office, as well as around the school  .  
More information on co-curricular offerings is available on  
the school’s website  .
Service Days
Throughout the year, Service Council organizes Service Days  . 
On those days, in exchange for a small donation or volunteering 
of time, students may dress in casual (non-uniform) clothing in 
support of a local charity or other worthy cause, as decided by 
Service Council  .
Y ear-End Calendar and Events
Towards the end of the school year in June, students experience 
a variety of year-end events and valuable activities that are an 
important part of ending the year and of the Middle School 
experience  . All students are expected to participate in the 
outdoor education trips, the year-end assembly, a sports activity 
afternoon and our Closing Ceremonies  .
Please do not make any travel arrangements that would prevent 
your child from taking part in these activities  . As the dates 
near, we will distribute a detailed year-end calendar with all 
the information necessary to help make the end of the year 
successful and as free of hassle as possible  ."

The school year has six terms  . In addition to major school 
holidays in December and at Spring Break, and there are also a 
number of long weekends throughout the year  . The dates are 
set in advance so that you can make early arrangements to avoid 
students missing school time  .
Students may not leave early for holidays and long weekends 
unless there is a very special reason . You, as their guardian, must 
request the leave in writing or via email to the Assistant Director, 
Student Life and Leadership of Senior School (see Holiday 
Extensions or Other Non-School Absences on the right) .
Drop-Off and Pick-Up
Traffic gets congested at the Richmond Road campus during 
peak drop-off and pick-up times for Middle and Senior school 
students  . Two entrances to campus exist: one on McRae Avenue 
and one on Knight Avenue  . Please avoid stopping in the middle 
of the roadway or driveway, as this impedes traffic flow  .
Parking
Student parking is very limited, and only vehicles with an 
authorized decal are permitted to park on school grounds  .
These vehicles must be registered with the Assistant Director, 
Student Life and students are required to explain their need 
to drive to school before a student can obtain a parking pass  . 
Unregistered student vehicles, those without a parking pass, or 
those illegally parked may have their wheels locked (resulting in 
a fine) or be towed without warning  .
Once parked at school, vehicles are to be left alone until the 
owners leave campus  . Vehicles are not to be used as book 
lockers, sports lockers or social centres  . Students are not 
authorized to park their vehicles along the roads bordering the 
school where it is posted “Residential Parking Only  .” Vehicles 
can be towed without warning if these signs are not respected  . 
Vehicles are left at the owner’s risk; SMUS accepts no 
responsibility for vehicles left on campus  .
Boarders are not allowed to keep motorized vehicles at the 
school, nor to rent, borrow, or drive any vehicle while under 
school jurisdiction . School buses or public transportation take 
care of most of the transportation needs of boarders  .Absences and Lateness
Parents are asked to leave a message at 250-370-6133 or email 
srattendance@smus  .ca before 8 am when your child is going to 
be absent .
Off-Campus Leave During the School Day
All students must sign out at the reception desk when leaving 
campus for any reason during the school day  . Grade 9 and 10 
students are not permitted to leave the campus without 
permission from a parent . This can be done by either signing the 
student out at reception, by calling 250-370-6133, or by emailing 
srattendance@smus  .ca . Grade 11 and 12 students may sign 
out for the lunch break and medical appointments
Holiday Extensions or Other Non-School Absences
All day and boarding students are expected to attend all 
academic classes, except under exceptional circumstances  . Any 
student who will be missing school time for vacations, non-
school-organized trips or other priorities must have their parents 
or guardians email the Director of Senior School at srattendance@
smus  .ca before making their travel arrangements to request 
permission for their child to miss school and provide the specific 
reason for the absence  . Students shall not leave early unless this 
procedure has been completed  . Requests should be received 
at least one week before the planned absence to ensure 
sufficient time to meet with teachers  .
Once permission has been granted, students must complete 
a “Green Sheet” to inform their teachers of their plans and to 
collect work to complete while they are away  . The green sheet 
must be returned to the Attendance Administrator for day 
students and to Boarding Services for boarding students within 
three days prior to departure  . The Attendance Administrator or 
Boarding Services will then forward the completed green sheet 
and formal request from parents to the Director of Senior School  
for final approval  .
Boarding parents should then input the information as required 
within the REACH electronic system .
Please note that holiday extension absences are considered as 
“unexcused” by the Ministry of Education and will be recorded  
as such on the school report card  .Senior School Information"
28,"St. Michaels University SchoolFamily Handbook 2024-25  |  24Illnesses and Medical Appointments
Day students who feel unwell during the day must contact their 
parent or guardian and be picked up as soon as possible  . Day 
students are required to sign out at the office  .
Boarding students who feel unwell during the day must see the 
nurse on duty in the Health Centre  . Students may not excuse 
themselves from class for sickness  . Boarding students must 
check in with the nurse at the Health Centre and the nurse will 
determine appropriate care  . Boarding students who are not well 
enough to attend classes will also have their off-campus leave 
suspended for the remainder of the day  .
Students who have medical or dental appointments must sign 
in and out at School House reception .
Smartphones
Our school aims to create an environment in which students are 
focused and present, both in class and during non-instructional 
time  . The school is continually examining its smartphone culture, 
consulting with students and faculty, while being guided by the 
best available research . While it is clear that smartphones offer 
many benefits, it is widely accepted that excessive screen time 
can lead to many negative side effects, including distraction and 
mental health issues, and may be harmful to school culture  .
While students may bring smartphones to school, they are 
not permitted to use them at any time during class, in grade 
meetings, in Chapel, or during assembly  . During other times of 
the school day, students are encouraged to use their devices 
responsibly, and may be asked to put them away if they are not 
contributing to a healthy school environment . We recognize 
this may be a challenge for some students and we will work 
alongside them to help them find effective strategies  .
Students who are unable to meet these standards can expect 
a range of consequences, including having their phones 
confiscated, being asked to check their phones in the morning, 
or having a phone-use contract put in place  . Parents who are 
concerned about their child’s phone use are encouraged to 
keep phones at home  .Security of Personal Items
The school strongly recommends that students record serial 
numbers of items brought to campus and that they enable any 
smartphone locator apps  . It is also highly recommended that 
students use their lockers and not leave their bags unattended  .
Communication of Student Learning
Our primary goal is to ensure that there is ongoing, regular 
communication about how your child is progressing 
throughout their learning  .
Homeroom Advisors will connect with parents at the start of 
the school year and then throughout the year, when necessary, 
to communicate student progress and concerns  . Houseparents 
report at regular intervals on the progress of boarding 
students  . At the discretion of the Director of Senior School, 
a specific update on student progress may be provided with 
action items to address  .
Although there is a regular schedule of formal communication 
of student learning, parents are welcome to contact their child’s 
teacher at any time to discuss any issues that arise  .
Student-Teacher-Parent (STeP) Conferences
Formal STeP conferences are arranged via video conferencing 
using Google Meet throughout the year  . Dates and times 
are published in the online calendar  . Please watch for emails 
from the Assistant to the Director of the Senior School for an 
invitation and registration details  .
We understand boarding parents will have difficulty attending 
the designated parent-teacher meetings  . However, should there 
be an opportunity, the Assistant to the Director of Senior School, 
in consultation with the student’s Homeroom Advisor, will be 
happy to arrange teacher meetings at another time  . To this end, 
we ask for adequate prior notice so that teachers can effectively 
prepare for these meetings  . At all times through the school year, 
individual teachers can be contacted by telephone or by email 
for information and updates on a student’s progress  .
If you have questions regarding academic information and 
guidelines, please contact Denise Lamarche, Director of 
Academics, at denise  .lamarche@smus  .ca ."
29,"St. Michaels University SchoolFamily Handbook 2024-25  |  25University Counselling Centre
The University Counselling Centre assists students in making 
course choices, post-secondary planning, enrolling in summer 
and enrichment programs, and career exploration . Five academic 
or university advisors and an administrative assistant help students 
from Grades 9-12, with small group and individual appointments 
required of all students in Grades 10-12 . We encourage parent 
participation in any stage of the post-secondary process  .
The Centre features university catalogues and viewbooks from 
around the world, as well as resource and reference books (many 
of which are also available in The Snowden Library) to help 
guide students and their parents in the post-secondary research 
and application process  . These include resource books for career 
planning, scholarship opportunities, and standardized testing  .
The Centre also maintains a website for students and a 
university- and career-planning portal called MaiaLearning, that 
students can access  . Our administrative assistant supports many 
aspects of the application process, including arranging, at a 
student’s request, for transcripts to be sent to universities  .
In addition to presentations by representatives from post-
secondary institutions from around the world, we also host 
information evenings each year for you and your child  . The 
first is for Grade 12 students and parents in September and the 
second, in late January, focuses on the course selection process 
for the next academic year  . Additionally, regular postings at 
smus  .ca/news throughout the year address a range of topics 
related to university counselling  .
Academic Advisors
Students’ timetables indicate the academic advisor that supports 
them . Academic advisors are the student’s and parent’s primary 
contact to discuss any program or course planning, as well as 
post-secondary planning  . All course changes and program 
questions or issues should be brought to the academic advisor  .
The Snowden Library
Hours:
Monday-Thursday  7:30 am - 9 pm
Friday  7:30 am - 4 pm
Sunday  1-6 pm
The library is also open on Saturdays during exam periods  . 
Library hours are emailed to students during exam periods  .
The teacher-librarian is available during school hours to answer 
reference questions and guide students in research and reading  .
Library Expectations
Quiet conversations, reflection, reading and study are 
encouraged  . Drinks are allowed but no food  . Respect for others 
and appropriate computer etiquette by all users is essential at all 
times  . All students should be engaged in reading, quiet study or 
academic collaborative work  . Anyone who disrupts the library 
will be asked to leave  . If unacceptable behaviour persists, a 
student may lose their library privileges  .Facilities
The Snowden Library occupies two floors in School House  . The 
study carrels in the whisper zone offer a quiet place for students 
to study in an otherwise busy library  . The group study rooms 
offer spaces for collaborative work and are equipped with multi-
touch digital monitors and webcams  . The library also has  
a Media Room . The library art gallery displays student art .
Library Information Literacy (Grades 9-12)
Students in all grades receive instruction from the teacher-
librarian based on the Grade 9-12 information literacy skills 
curriculum . This is taught through collaborative, integrated 
research assignments that are planned by the teacher-librarian 
in collaboration with subject teachers  .
Councils, Clubs and Activities
In all facets of student life, we want our students to take initiative 
and pursue opportunities that interest them . With the support of 
a dedicated faculty, we offer a wide range of clubs and councils 
through which students contribute to school life  .
Our students put tremendous effort into school life, and we 
encourage all students to get involved in existing clubs or to 
start their own . For detailed information on extracurricular 
options, see the school’s website  .
Advanced Placement
Advanced Placement courses are rigorous university-level courses 
with examinations developed by the College Board, of Princeton, 
New Jersey  . The benefits of taking an Advanced Placement 
course and examination include intellectual challenge, academic 
enrichment and excellent preparation for university-level studies  . 
Students who achieve high standing in an Advanced Placement 
examination may receive university credit, advanced placement 
or exemption from certain university courses  .
AP Exam Information for Students
AP exams typically occur in early May  . Exam dates and times will 
be posted on the SMUS calendar as they become available  .
Students must ensure they maintain academic responsibilities 
in their other courses during the AP exam session and plan 
accordingly  .
The school does not send the AP exam score (1-5) to post-
secondary institutions; this is a separate process between the 
student and the College Board  . Students should speak to their 
academic advisors about how universities regard AP exam 
scores or if they provide university credit ."
30,"St. Michaels University SchoolFamily Handbook 2024-25  |  26Senior School Workload Guidelines
Students are expected to discuss any academic issues 
with their teachers well in advance of any assessments or 
due dates.
• When scheduling tests and assignments, teachers confer 
with their students and endeavour to determine dates that 
are mutually agreeable  .
• Students are provided with sufficient notice of major 
assignments and of tests that require significant studying 
or that represent a large percentage of their term mark  .
• Assessment dates and due dates for major assignments 
are recorded on the calendar posted on the school data 
system (SDS) . Students are advised to refer to SDS regularly  . 
• Non-scheduled assessments (e  .g ., quizzes) generally do 
not exceed 15 minutes in length and may or may not 
count for marks  .
• Major assignments and assessments will not be scheduled 
for the week prior to exams  . This includes school exams 
and discipline-specific Advanced Placement exams  . If 
there is a conflict for an individual student, a discussion 
must take place, in advance, between teacher and student 
to determine a plan .
• Students are not expected to write more than two major 
assessments per day or five per week  . If students show 
as ‘overloaded’ in SDS, they are advised to speak directly 
to their Academic Advisor and/or Homeroom Advisor  . A 
major assessment is one that meets one or more of the 
following criteria: covers a substantial amount of material; 
requires a significant amount of preparation; requires more 
than half a period to write; or has a significant weighting in 
the students’ overall grade  .
• Students are not expected to write tests or submit 
assignments on the first day back after a long weekend  .
• Homework is not assigned over long weekends or holiday 
periods  . Advanced Placement courses may require 
additional reading and review, to be agreed upon in class  . 
Students registered in Advanced Placement courses 
should enrol in these courses with this understanding  .
• Students who have been absent for several days due to 
illness, field trips or team commitments are not compelled to 
write an assessment on their first day back  . It is the student’s 
responsibility to make appropriate arrangements, in advance, 
with the teacher, as per the Late Assessment Policy  .
• Teachers consider the situation of students involved in 
activities such as the school musical, school concerts, 
outdoor leadership trips and major athletic tournaments 
when assigning work and scheduling assessments and 
assignments  . It is the student’s responsibility to make 
appropriate arrangements, in advance, with the teacher  .
• Homework is assigned regularly and is a valuable 
university preparatory learning experience, helping 
students learn how to focus, study independently and 
take responsibility for completing assignments  . Success 
in academics is greatly enhanced by developing strong 
independent work habits  .Homework volume will fluctuate during the school year and 
when project deadlines approach . Homework time may also 
fluctuate as a function of an individual student’s work habits 
rather than reflecting the time a teacher may have expected 
the homework to take  . Students and parents are advised to 
monitor work habits more than the time it takes to complete 
assignments when considering homework-load issues and 
communicate with teachers immediately should issues 
arise  . Clear and regular communication is critical to ongoing 
homework and independent study success  .
These are guidelines only  . Students and teachers may 
work outside these guidelines, provided they agree . Any 
questions or concerns should be addressed to the student’s 
teacher and the Assistant Director of Academics  .
Late Assessment Policy (Revised 2023)
Rationale
An essential part of preparing oneself for life is acquiring the 
necessary work ethic and habits of mind that lead to success  . 
The goal of the SMUS Late Work Policy is to help students 
develop their organizational skills, learning behaviours, and 
executive functioning to meet responsibilities and honour 
commitments  .
The Late Work Policy applies to all forms of assessment and 
assigned student work  . We expect that students will be 
proactive in communication and follow-through with their 
teachers  .
The Proactive Student and the Supportive Teacher
It is the responsibility of every student to ensure that they 
complete assignments and meet course deadlines as outlined 
by the teacher  . Teachers will work with students to ensure 
an appropriate amount of time is provided to complete 
assignments  .
Tutorial time is provided to students for opportunities to meet 
with teachers and obtain extra help  . Such times include morning 
tutorial (8:00-8:30), lunch time, spares, and/or immediately 
after school  . These times are negotiated between students and 
teachers, with an effort to find times that are mutually agreeable  .
Students who know they will have difficulty completing an 
assignment or assessment by the due date must communicate 
with the teacher at least two days in advance to:
• explain the mitigating circumstances
• ensure that the student understands the assessment 
requirements and can complete it
• negotiate an alternative due date
The consequences outlined below are all subject to the 
discretion of the teacher in their application ."
31,"St. Michaels University SchoolFamily Handbook 2024-25  |  27Level 1: Missed Deadline
If a student has not met with their teachers in advance and has 
failed to meet the original deadline, the student must
• meet with the teacher in person to explain the 
circumstances and ensure that the student understands 
the assessment requirements and can complete it . It is 
the student’s responsibility to make arrangements for 
additional help with the teacher if deemed necessary  .
• be available to meet with the teacher, if additional help 
is needed, during one or all of the following: morning 
tutorial, lunch, after school, spares  .
The teacher
• will determine if extra help or structured work time is 
needed for the student to complete the work before the 
new deadline  .
• will support the student and work together with them to 
negotiate an alternative due date  .
• may, if late assignments are a repeated occurrence with 
the student, bring the lateness to the attention of the 
student’s Homeroom Advisor, Academic Advisor, and 
parents/houseparent (via phone call or email)
If the above measures do not result in completion of the work as 
per the new due date, the student moves to Level 2.
Level 2: Second Missed Deadline
Students who fail to meet the second negotiated deadline may 
experience one or more of the following consequences:
• referral to their Homeroom Advisor and Academic Advisor 
for the record• parents and/or houseparents will be informed
• requirement to meet with the Assistant Director of 
Academics to discuss the issue and to determine a time, 
place, and process for the missing assessment to be 
completed
• requirement to attend supervised extra help sessions until 
the assessment is complete  . The time of these sessions will 
be determined by the teacher  .
• the student may be removed from extra-curricular 
activities and free time under the supervision of the 
teacher, the Homeroom Advisor and/or the Assistant 
Director of Academics  .
• an ‘I’ (incomplete) or “IE” (insufficient evidence) may 
be assigned as a course grade until the assessment is 
complete  .
If the above measures do not result in completion of the work, 
it may become necessary to consider alternative supports to 
ensure that the student remains on track academically  . These 
supports may impact the student’s ability to participate fully 
in the extra-curricular program at the school  . This decision will 
be made collaboratively with the teacher, Assistant Director of 
Academics, and the Director of the Senior School  .
Level 3: Work is not completed before the conclusion 
of the academic year
If, after every effort, the work is not submitted at the end of the 
academic year, the grade for any unsubmitted or incomplete 
assessments will be converted to zero  .Late Assessment Policy (cont.)"
32,"St. Michaels University SchoolFamily Handbook 2024-25  |  28Behaviour and Discipline
The school embraces the principles of restorative practices, 
which includes helping students understand the impact of their 
actions and working with students to repair harm . However, in 
cases where there is a serious breach of school rules, students 
may be suspended or expelled  . Offences which require mention 
include the following:
Peer Conflict, Mean Behaviour and/or Bullying
The school has a comprehensive policy, “Supporting the Social 
and Emotional Development of our Students,” that details our 
response to situations involving peer conflict, mean behaviour, 
and bullying, including cyberbullying  . The school’s Social and 
Emotional Development Policy can be found on the Links for 
Current Parents section of our website  .
While conflict is considered a normal part of peer interaction 
and a student’s academic discourse, SMUS views conflict that 
includes mean behaviour or bullying as unacceptable and will 
respond accordingly  .
We use language that includes peer conflict, mean behaviour, 
and bullying to educate our students on the topic of social 
conflict, as well as to help guide us towards an appropriate 
response  . As each situation is unique, the school has a variety of 
responses that it uses to help resolve conflicts  . These responses 
seek to rebuild relationships first; only if a situation warrants it is 
a more punitive approach considered  .
These actions may include:
• restorative techniques including restorative circles
• guidance, with a warning of consequences should the 
behaviour continue
• student behaviour contracts
• suspension (in-school or out-of-school)
• expulsion
The school may involve experts from the community and, if 
necessary, the local police  . Additionally, should students want 
to report an incident of bullying anonymously, the school works 
cooperatively with the Ministry of Education and is a partner 
with erasebullying  .ca .
Theft
Students involved in theft may be subject to suspension  
or expulsion .
Marijuana and Drugs
Students found to be involved in the use of or in possession of 
marijuana in any form, or other drugs or drug paraphernalia, 
on or off the campus, or on any school-sanctioned excursion 
or field trip, will be subject to suspension or expulsion . If any 
student is found to be involved with marijuana in any form, or 
another drug, and is suspended for their use, a condition of their 
return may be a behavioural contract that includes drug testing  .Vaping and Smoking
Consistent with British Columbia law, the school campus is 
a smoke-free and vape-free zone  . This applies to the use of 
e-cigarettes and/or vaporizers, including those that do not 
contain nicotine  . Students are not allowed to smoke or vape 
at any time or in any location, on or off the campus, or on any 
school-sanctioned excursion or field trip  . Students are also not 
permitted to possess any type of e-cigarette and/or vaporizer, 
including those that do not contain nicotine  .
Alcohol
Students must not be under the influence of alcohol while on or 
off the campus, or on any school-sanctioned excursion or field 
trip . It is against the school rules for any student to consume, 
purchase, or be in possession of alcohol on campus or during a 
school event .
Weapons
Any student found to be in possession of a dangerous weapon 
on or off the campus, or on any school-sanctioned excursion or 
field trip, will be subject to suspension or expulsion .
Parties
The school does not support the holding of parties at students’ 
homes where alcohol is served or where there is no parental 
supervision . If parties are held under these unacceptable 
conditions, the school strongly encourages parents to 
prevent their children from attending and to notify the school 
administration .
Public Displays of Affection
Students at SMUS must be considerate of all people within the 
community regarding expressions of affection . Public displays of 
affection that may make others uncomfortable because of their 
intimate nature are inappropriate  . We are a diverse community 
in many ways, and what may be acceptable to some could 
make others feel uncomfortable  . It is important that students are 
aware of the entire school community and conduct themselves 
accordingly  ."
33,"St. Michaels University SchoolFamily Handbook 2024-25  |  29Dress Code for Senior School Students
Dress and Appearance
Appropriate dress is expected of all students, including day students travelling to and from school, or staying on the school campus 
after regular hours  . We expect students to respect themselves and be proud of their school  . This self-respect and pride is reflected in a 
student’s general appearance  . Students who opt not to meet these criteria will be referred to the Assistant Director, Student Life  .

The boarding staff, faculty and administration welcome you to 
the boarding program at St . Michaels University School! We are 
so glad you are here and we look forward to your contribution 
to our school  . The following information is designed to help 
with the transition into the SMUS boarding community and with 
day-to-day life while students live in boarding  . We encourage 
you to refer to it when questions arise and seek answers 
from houseparents and the wider community if they are not 
answered in this handbook  .
The boarding program at SMUS is based on trust and respect . 
The school mission states that we prepare students for life  . This 
statement is especially true in the boarding community  . We 
will provide an environment for students to develop personal 
and social responsibility through engagement . They will learn 
to cooperate with people from diverse cultural backgrounds 
and, in turn, develop a better understanding of themselves  . 
They will cultivate a sense of independence and self-awareness 
that will enable them to conduct life challenges with increasing 
confidence  .
It is crucial that students make the most of their time at SMUS 
and become involved in a wide variety of activities  . House events 
and weekend outings, athletics, the arts and many of the other 
extracurricular opportunities thrive within our school program .  
Engaging with the community and broadening your horizons  
will teach the most valuable lessons students will ever learn .
Campus Life, House Allocation 
and Houseparents
The six boarding houses on campus operate under one 
philosophy: we promote an environment for students to 
develop personal and social responsibility through engagement . 
Students who choose to attend boarding school act in a spirit 
of honesty and goodwill, and do their best to contribute to all 
aspects of campus life  .
Toward the end of August, the Director of Boarding and Student 
Life, in consultation with members of Admissions and the 
Senior Houseparents, places new students into their houses  . 
New students are informed of their house name upon arrival in 
September  . Students are a member of this house throughout 
their time in boarding and will develop a strong sense of loyalty 
and house pride  .
Each house is staffed by Senior Houseparents who are 
responsible for the students in their house  . These Senior 
Houseparents also have at least five assistant houseparents  . 
House staff provide primary care and supervision, leadership 
and support for the boarders in their house  . Together, the 
houseparents help create a strong sense of community in the 
boarding houses  .
The Senior Houseparents invite each boarding family to meet 
with them during orientation or on the day that the students 
arrive at school  . This is a very important opportunity to connect, where parents can also discreetly share any information that 
might help the boarding staff to better support the students in 
their care and to quietly monitor any sensitive situations  .
Areas of particular concern to houseparents include things 
related to social, emotional or medical well-being, any recent 
changes in behaviour, or any background details (including formal 
assessments) . Similarly, if something develops during the course 
of the year, the school encourages parents to immediately contact 
their child’s Senior Houseparent or the medical staff to inform 
them of these details  . A lack of disclosure could compromise the 
school’s ability to properly care for your child  .
Telephone Calls and Messages
In the evening or on weekends, parents may contact the house 
staff or students by calling the offices at the numbers listed 
below  . For emergencies or for communications after office 
hours, parents of boarding students will be provided with the 
appropriate contact information upon arrival in September  .
Questions and enquiries of a general nature should be directed 
to the Boarding Services office at 250-370-6157 or the Director 
of Boarding and Student Life at 250-370-6136, between 8 am 
and 4 pm, Monday to Friday  .

35,"St. Michaels University SchoolFamily Handbook 2024-25  |  31Community Expectations
We believe that boarding life provides the opportunities 
for students to continually challenge themselves and their 
leadership capacities  . The following practices are used to 
guide students through this growth and in doing so create 
a community where they develop personal and social 
responsibility through engagement .
Our boarders lead by action, or “model the way  .” A student’s 
actions often speak louder than their words and to become 
involved in the community demonstrates their commitment .
In boarding we share a vision of ourselves, our school, our 
community and our world  . Our boarding students think 
towards the future and are able to communicate and share 
that vision with others  .
Our boarding students “challenge the process  .” They are not 
satisfied with the status quo, but embrace change  . They are 
innovators in the fields they choose  .
Successful boarders don’t act alone; they enable others to 
become involved  . These students understand and foster 
teamwork, encouraging others to exceed their own expectations  .
Finally, our boarding students “encourage the heart . ” This simply 
means they recognize and celebrate others  . This helps foster a 
strong sense of community  .
Living with Others 
Living away from home and with others may be a new 
experience for some students  . It is important to embrace the 
values of honesty, respect and consideration for others, and 
to practise open communication . Being open to new ideas 
and having the courage to try new things goes a long way to 
making new friends  .
Contribution to the Boarding House and Community 
Boarders are expected to get involved in a variety of athletic, 
artistic and service activities throughout the year  . It is extremely 
important that they participate in house games, community 
dinners and chapel, volunteer their time in the boarding house, 
and help promote a positive environment . By engaging with 
those around them, boarders are sure to gain the most from 
their boarding experience  .Care of the House 
There is one formal room check each week, but students are 
expected to keep their rooms tidy at all times  . Cleaning supplies 
are provided and cleaning staff take care of the common areas 
in the house  . Room decorations are subject to approval of the 
house staff and students may not decorate their rooms with 
inappropriate or offensive material  . This includes items that 
involve alcohol, illicit substances, nudity or suggestive behaviour  . 
Boarders are held responsible for the costs of repairs for any 
damage in their rooms or common areas  .
Prep 
Prep occurs each evening from Monday to Thursday from  
7 to 9 pm . This is a time of day when the house is quiet and 
all students from Grades 9-11 are in their rooms studying and 
preparing for the school days ahead  . It is a vital time in which 
students learn proper study habits and have time to organize 
themselves  .
Prep has a few simple guidelines:
• The doors to all students’ rooms are left open .
• No telephone or cellphone use is permitted  . We request 
that parents assist us by not calling their child from 7 to 
9 pm .
• Computers are used for school-related work only  .
• Students are sitting at their desks  .
• Students are prepared to begin work at 7 pm .
Visitors to the Boarding House
To ensure the safety and security of all students, visitors are 
only allowed in boarding houses at designated times and need 
permission from a houseparent . Students are not allowed to 
have visitors after check-in times or during the school day  .
Students visiting a boarding house that they do not live in are 
allowed access to common areas only  . If a student wishes to 
bring a friend to their room during the allowed times, they must 
first get permission from an on-duty houseparent .
Any student found to have not followed any of the above rules 
will be subject to discipline  ."
36,"St. Michaels University SchoolFamily Handbook 2024-25  |  32Behaviour and Discipline
Boarders are expected to behave in a manner that is respectful, 
trustworthy and appropriate in line with the school’s 
expectations for all students (see page 28) .
Boarders Electronic Distraction Policy
Electronics (i .e  ., computers, game systems, hand held games, 
cellphones and other similar devices) can be a distraction from 
academic study and disruptive to sleep patterns  . Therefore, 
the use of electronics may be restricted at the discretion of the 
Senior Houseparent .
Having electronics in a boarding room is an earned privilege 
that can be revoked  .
• Grade 8, 9 and 10 boarders are not permitted to have a 
game system at school, nor can they play on anyone else’s 
game system during the academic week  . They may be 
invited to play at appropriate times on the weekends, only 
if at least one of the occupants of the room is present .
• Grade 11 and 12 boarders in good academic standing 
must request permission from their Senior Houseparent 
before bringing a game system into their room .
• To develop strong sleep routines, students are expected to 
stop using electronic devices 30 minutes before lights-out .
Cellphones 
See page 16 for the Middle School (Grade 8) cellphone policy and 
page 21 for the Senior School (Grades 9-12) smartphone policy  .
Boarders should note that inappropriate use, including use 
during prep and after lights-out, is not permitted and could 
result in confiscation .
We recommend parents do not provide boarders with a 
cellphone plan that has unlimited access to data . The school has 
an on-campus WiFi network that is restricted during lights-out 
times to encourage healthy sleep and electronic-use habits 
among boarders  . Parents are encouraged to monitor their child’s 
cellphone bills and to speak with a Senior Houseparent if they 
have concerns  .
If an initial cellphone package is set up by an adult for a boarder, 
please advise the Boarding Services Coordinator of the adult’s 
name, particularly if the bills are going to be sent to the boarder 
at the school’s address  . Otherwise, if the recipient cannot be 
identified, bills will be sent back  . Please note that cellphone bills 
cannot be paid through the school account .Sign-In and Lights-Out Times 
Every evening, the houseparents on duty ensure that all 
boarders are safely in their houses at sign-in time  .
On weekends, boarders who are not on weekend leave are 
expected to sign in with the houseparent on duty between  
10 and 10:30 am to discuss plans for the day  .
Students are expected to check in to their house and proceed  
to their own rooms by the following times:
Sign-in Times Grade 8 Grades 9-11 Grade 12
Sunday to 
Thursday10 pm 10 pm 10:30 pm
Friday and 
Saturday11 pm 11 pm 11:30 pm
The school strongly believes that a proper amount of sleep is 
an important part of every student’s overall health and ability 
to function at optimum levels  . This includes putting electronic 
devices away after evening check-in . Students are expected to 
be in their own rooms with the lights out at their designated 
lights-out time:
Lights-out

Sunday to 
Thursday10:30 pm 10:30 pm 11 pm
Friday and 
Saturday11:30 pm 11:30 pm Midnight
Between lights-out and 6:30 am the next morning, students 
need to obtain special permission from a houseparent in order 
to leave their boarding house  ."
37,"St. Michaels University SchoolFamily Handbook 2024-25  |  33Boarding Curriculum
Sunday afternoons and evenings every weekend immediately 
following any school holiday are times for the full boarding 
community to come together for special events such as house 
games and community dinners  . All boarders must be on 
campus and engaged in these activities  .
Activities On and Off Campus
Houseparents offer a variety of weekend activities every 
weekend  . Special events like golf, photography, yoga, rock 
climbing, ice hockey and many others are offered to help 
students explore their Island home  . Some of these activities 
will cost little or no money, while the more extensive options 
may require payment and parent permission . Students in 
Grades 9 and 10 are expected to participate and all boarders 
are welcome  . Grade 8 students have their own set program of 
activities  . The Outdoor Education department plans activities 
on certain weekends such as hiking, sailing, skiing, kayaking 
and surfing  . Information about the activities and trips will be 
distributed through announcements a few weeks prior  . Students 
wishing to participate in the trip will need to complete a 
registration form and pay up front .
Personal Effects
Required Items
In addition to all toiletries, casual clothing, outerwear and school 
uniform, boarders require the following items:
• Labelled large suitcases or plastic tubs for storage 
purposes (maximum of two)
• Two pairs of fitted sheets and pillowcases (for an OVERSIZE 
twin bed - measurement of mattress is 37” x 78” , or 94 cm x 
198 cm)*

bed*
• Clothes hangers*
• Mug, bowl and cutlery, water bottle
• Bath towels (four) and face cloths (two)*

the desk and night table)
• Musical instrument
• Surge-protected power bar for electronics
• Personal sports equipment (tennis/badminton racquet, ice 
skates, skateboard and helmet, etc  .)
• Bicycle and helmet . (The boarding community has shared 
bicycles to borrow, but avid cyclists are welcome to bring 
their own bike  . Please bring a high-quality bike lock  .)
Please note: each house has a storage room with bike racks and 
a room for luggage, trunks or plastic tubs, sports equipment 
and any other items, however, space is limited  . When preparing 
for school, please use a clearly labelled, lockable trunk or plastic 
storage container  .
Items kept in storage are locked and students may gain access 
to this room by asking a houseparent . The school does not take 
responsibility for any lost, damaged or stolen articles in the house  .
Items Not Allowed 
• Fridges (this is a Grade 12 privilege only)
• Cooking appliances (e  .g ., hot plates, microwaves,  
rice cookers) or electrical equipment without an 
automatic shutoff
• Televisions
• Pets
• Matches, lighters, candles or incense
• Empty alcohol bottles
• Subwoofers
• Weapons of any kind (including pocketknives)
• Motorized vehicles
• Computer monitors over 24”
• Personal gaming devices"
38,"St. Michaels University SchoolFamily Handbook 2024-25  |  34Safety and Security
All student rooms can be locked and each student is given 
one key to their room at the beginning of the year along with 
a swipe card to access their building  . If a key or card goes 
missing, a request for a new one must be submitted to the 
Senior Houseparent along with payment . New swipe cards can 
be obtained at the Campus Shop  . Possession of a key or card 
belonging to someone else is strictly forbidden .
Students should not keep large amounts of cash in their rooms 
or on their person at any time  . The possibility of theft is an 
unfortunate reality in any large institution . Using a debit or credit 
card provides a better level of security  .
We encourage students to:
• Make use of a debit or credit card to avoid the need to 
have large amounts of cash on hand  .
• Avoid bringing items of significant value to school  . Always 
secure all valuables in the lockable top desk drawer and 
bring a combination lock  .
• When in class, lock your room and carry your key and card 
with you  .
• Register your bike with project529 .com .
• Use the fireproof vault in the Boarding Services office for 
storing extra travel money, passports or other important 
documents  .
• Introduce all your visitors to your houseparents  . If strangers 
are on campus, report them to a houseparent or Campus 
Security immediately  .
Throughout the year the boarding community conducts a series 
of fire and earthquake drills in which all boarders participate  . 
Every room is equipped with a smoke detector  . Furniture in the 
rooms must be arranged in a way that does not impede access 
to the door  . The fire marshal conducts regular inspections and 
requires that belongings be stored properly and nothing be left 
in the hallways  .Insurance 
The school cannot be held responsible for any items lost or 
stolen . It is the individual’s responsibility to ensure that their own 
valuables are securely locked away when not in use  . The school 
does not provide insurance for the students  . If there are items of 
considerable value being kept on campus, we strongly suggest 
that parents ensure that their homeowner’s insurance policy 
covers their child’s possessions while at school  . A record of serial 
numbers may be helpful when trying to track down missing 
items  ."
39,"St. Michaels University SchoolFamily Handbook 2024-25  |  35Leave Guidelines
There are opportunities throughout the week where students may leave campus, provided that all their school commitments have 
been met and they sign out properly  . Students are always responsible for informing the houseparents of their plans and following 
proper sign-out procedures  . They must also communicate any changes that occur  .

**Grade 8 Leave: As the year progresses and Grade 8 students 
demonstrate a sense of responsibility, they have an 
opportunity to earn more independence (Grade 9 Leave 
Guidelines) . The decision is made by the Senior Houseparent, 
Grade 8 coordinator and Director of Boarding and Student Life 
on a student-by-student basis  . Parents are notified before their 
child earns more independence  .Local Leave: Hillside Shopping Centre, Shelbourne Plaza, local 
recreation centres or tennis courts  . These are all within 10 to 
15 minutes walking distance  .
Downtown and other locations: When signing out to go 
downtown or other locations, your listed destination must 
be specific (i .e  ., which stores, theatres or restaurants) . Simply 
declaring “downtown” is not acceptable  .
• Students who are too sick to attend classes will be denied 
off-campus leave  .
• Travelling in groups is recommended, especially for 
Grade 8, 9 and 10 students and those for whom English is 
not their first language  .
• If any student expects to be off campus for more 
than four hours they must phone to check in with the 
houseparent on duty  .
• Boarders may be allowed to go to a day student’s house 
if they are properly supervised by the host parent(s) . 
Permission for these events will be granted at the 
houseparent’s discretion ."
40,"St. Michaels University SchoolFamily Handbook 2024-25  |  36Submitting Leave Requests - REACH
All leave requests are submitted via an electronic leave approval 
system called REACH . Full details must be entered, including 
name of the person the boarder will stay with, address, phone 
number, time and date leaving, time and date returning, and 
mode of transportation both ways  . If plane travel is involved, 
flight itineraries must be entered into the Notes field of the 
form . If a boarder is going to more than one location, details for 
each must be entered  . Once saved, parents and hosts will each 
receive an email asking that they review the request and either 
Approve or Reject the details  . Once all confirmations are in, the 
Boarding Services Coordinator will provide the final approval  .
It is important that as much detail as possible be submitted 
on these requests; house staff and the Boarding Services 
Coordinator need to know how to locate people at any given 
time, particularly in emergency situations  .
Overnight Leave
Weekend leave will be granted to students, but they must make 
arrangements via REACH no later than the Thursday evening 
prior to the weekend in question . If all details are not entered 
or approvals are not obtained from parents and hosts well in 
advance of travel, leave will be rejected  .
Major Breaks and Long Weekends
The school breaks are designed to provide students and staff 
with the well-needed rest that is required when living in the 
busy environment of boarding  . Winter Holiday and Spring 
Break are longer and students are expected to spend time with 
their families  . Most of the four-day weekends coincide with a 
statutory holiday  .
As with weekend leave, all off-campus breaks require the 
completion of a leave form in REACH with full details  .
When electronic leave forms are submitted to the Boarding 
Services Coordinator prior to each of the long weekends 
or major breaks, all details must be completely filled in . This 
includes each place the boarder will stay and all methods of 
transportation . For example, if the boarder intends to return 
home but is staying in Vancouver for a day or two en route, all 
their Vancouver travel details should be included on the form .
Alternatively, if a child is leaving the country for a period of 
time during their stay within Canada or the United States, that 
information must also be provided  . This information will be used 
to locate people in emergency situations  .
Please note that leave permission will not be granted to a 
destination where there is no responsible adult to assume full 
responsibility for that student for the duration of the leave in 
question . Parents are asked to respect this requirement and 
not request weekend leave for their child to any unsupervised 
locations, including hotels  .Due to the high volume of processing all leave forms for a break, 
students are asked to submit their requests at least two weeks 
in advance, and parents and hosts are asked to submit their 
approvals as quickly as possible  .
We ask that if your child is travelling by air at any time during the 
school year, the flights originate from and return to Victoria, if at 
all possible  . This avoids any potential problems with ferry travel 
between Victoria and Vancouver  .
Missing Academic Time 
If it is absolutely necessary that a boarder either leave early and/
or return late from a break, the reason must be entered into the 
REACH leave request, in Notes  . Permission to miss classes is only 
granted by the Director of Senior School (who must also receive 
details from the parents) . Students must fill out the necessary 
paperwork (called a ‘green sheet’ and obtained from the 
Boarding Services Coordinator) . This involves speaking to each 
individual teacher for classes they will be missing  .
We request that when booking flights, families adhere to the 
dates set by the school  . Students may leave early in exceptional 
circumstances  . To leave early or return late means that they 
will miss not only valuable class time, but possibly important 
boarding events  . Students may be expected to make up any 
time missed when they return to school  .
If, after submitting the correct leave request, the leave time 
is changed, the student must speak to the Boarding Services 
Coordinator  . Boarders may not change their destination within 
the last week before a break, unless extreme circumstances 
necessitate a change  . In those cases, parents must contact the 
Boarding Services Coordinator directly  .
As students are usually expected to leave immediately after their 
last exam or school obligation, it is strongly recommended that 
when booking the original tickets, they should be the type that 
can easily be changed to accommodate the exam schedule  ."
41,"St. Michaels University SchoolFamily Handbook 2024-25  |  37Travel Documents and Study Permits
Please ensure that all the relevant documentation, visas and 
study permits are in place before school starts  . 
Upon arrival at school:
• All students are required to present their passport to the 
Boarding Services Coordinator  . The passport must remain 
on campus: either with the student or in the Boarding 
Services office’s fireproof vault . (Passports are available to 
the student at any time during office hours  .)
• All international students must be in possession of a 
Canadian Study Permit (Student Visa) valid for the entire 
school year  . Not only is this a requirement of the Canadian 
government, but also for the BC Medical Services Plan . 
Medical coverage will not be granted without a copy of 
the study permit .
• Any student arriving in September without a valid Study 
Permit will not be allowed into class until they obtain 
the proper documentation . This is a legal requirement 
of Canadian immigration . The parent or guardian is 
responsible for following this process  .
• Canadian students who were not born in Canada must 
bring the original or photocopy of both sides of their 
permanent resident card or both sides of their Canadian 
citizenship certificate  .
• Any boarder coming from a “visa-exempt country” must 
obtain an eTA (Electronic Travel Authorization) before 
entering Canada . This is a simple process which can be 
completed online on the Canadian Government website  .
All travellers are required to show their passport when crossing 
the border into the United States  . A US visitor visa is a must-
have for possible school trips  . International families are strongly 
encouraged to obtain US visitor visas prior to arrival at SMUS . 
Even if a school trip is passing through the United States, an 
“in transit” visa may be required  . Travel to Vancouver to obtain 
US visas is discouraged as it involves weekday absence and 
substantial expense  . Students applying for US visitor visas from 
inside Canada must have been in Canada for one year before 
they will be considered  .
Transportation
During the term, students are strongly encouraged to travel by 
public transit whenever possible, as this is reasonably priced 
and easily accessible  . Bus tickets are available from the Boarding 
Services Coordinator and several buses stop close to campus  .
As part of our school’s policy to be environmentally sensitive, we 
discourage the use of taxis  . However, a taxi may be necessary in 
the evenings or for a daytime medical appointment . Please note 
that if a medical appointment cannot be scheduled outside of 
class time, a taxi chit will automatically be issued to the student 
by the Health Centre  . Other than for medical reasons, students are 
expected to pay directly for taxi travel by cash or debit/credit card  .Boarders Bus
SMUS provides a boarders bus for students who are travelling to 
the ferry on most weekends and an additional bus to the airport 
prior to longer school breaks  .
Please note:
• Students must reserve their seat on the bus on their  
leave request .
• Changes to boarders bus reservations may be made up  
to 24 hours before travelling  .
• Late cancellations or no-shows will be charged  .
• Boarders must sign in and scan their student card at the 
bus at least five minutes before departure  . Late arrivals  
will have to arrange their own transportation .
If students need to travel to downtown Vancouver, they may 
purchase a ticket for the BC Ferries Connector bus on the ferry  .
If a student is flying, the bus can also stop at the airport . Parents 
are asked to arrange flights which correspond with the bus 
times if at all possible:
• For a 3:30 pm boarders bus departure, the plane should 
not depart from Victoria before 5 pm .
• For a 1:30 pm boarders bus departure, the plane should 
not depart from Victoria before 3 pm .
There is no pick-up at the airport for the boarder’s return trip  
to campus  .
Services Available to Boarding Students
Boarding Services
The Boarding Services Coordinator is responsible for the 
operation of the Boarding Services office  . In addition to other 
functions, this office looks after many of the external needs of 
boarding students, including:
• Assisting in the processing of student visa renewals 
(Canadian Study Permits);
• Processing travel requests, leave forms, confirmation of 
long weekend leave and arranging the boarders bus;
• Handling student and parent enquiries;
• Safely storing passports, visas, notarized letters and any 
other important documentation;
• Distributing boarder mail;
• Organization of boarder participation in various social 
functions throughout the year, including Boarders Without 
Borders and the Family Gala .
City bus tickets are available through the Boarding Services 
office, but the Boarding Services Coordinator does not provide 
petty cash to students  . All boarders are required to have a 
bank account with a debit card for their basic spending needs  . 
Emergency funds can be obtained from the ATM in the Boarding 
Services office  . Assistance to set up a new bank account is 
provided during the New Boarder Orientation ."

All incoming mail is directed to the houses through the 
Boarding Services office  . Each house appoints a mail person 
who collects the mail each day and delivers it to the house  . 
Friends and relatives should address all mail by stating the 
student’s name, house, room number and full school address  . 
For example:
Ron Jones (Boarder)

Bolton House - Room #203 
St . Michaels University School 
3400 Richmond Road 
Victoria, British Columbia  V8P 4P5 
Canada
All packages or couriered document deliveries to boarders 
are held in the Campus Shop for pick-up  . Deliveries are never 
brought directly to the houses  . Boarders are notified of deliveries 
by looking for their name on the whiteboard outside of the 
Campus Shop  . Please note that the school does not pay for 
custom charges; when an amount is owing, the Boarding 
Services Coordinator will let the student know to pick up a 
waybill slip, detailing the charges and who to contact with 
payment . The courier company will hold onto the package until 
all fees are paid  .
Students are expected to place their own postage on outgoing 
mail  . If packages are to be couriered, they may be sent from 
the school reception with the charges going directly to the 
boarder’s school account . However, packages to be sent by 
regular post need to be taken directly to the post office  . There is 
a post office at the nearby Hillside Shopping Centre  .
Parents should monitor their child’s online purchases and 
speak to a Senior Houseparent if you have any issues  . We value 
sustainability and do not want to encourage overconsumption 
and wasteful spending habits  .
Medical Services
St . Michaels University School promotes health and wellness 
through the on-campus Health Centre, which serves the 
boarding student population .
All boarding students are expected to be registered for the 
BC provincial health care plan (MSP) . If not on the plan before 
entry into the school, the school will automatically sign up each 
boarder for coverage  . Monthly charges will be debited from 
students’ accounts for the entire time at the school, including 
summer months to allow for uninterrupted coverage  . There 
is a three-month waiting period for MSP  . All new international 
boarding students are, therefore, signed up for three-month 
coverage from JF Insurance, which is charged to students’ 
accounts  .
The Health Centre is supported by the school doctors to address 
the medical needs of the boarding students  . Nurses will triage 
and arrange for boarding students to see the school doctor as 
needed  . Hours vary depending on the doctor’s availability  .The Health Centre arranges appointments for boarding students 
to external specialists including dentists, orthodontists, and 
optometrists  . Emergency services are provided through Royal 
Jubilee Hospital or Victoria General Hospital  . Athletic injuries are 
addressed by the school’s athletic therapist, and students can 
book appointments online at smus  .ca/campus-services/athletic-
therapy  .
Please note: If students are not well enough to attend classes, the 
nurse will determine where they will rest, and they will also have 
their off-campus leave suspended for the remainder of the day  .
Food and Dining
Meals are served in our dining hall, Graves Hall, three times per 
day (breakfast, lunch and dinner), except Saturday and Sunday 
when breakfast and lunch are replaced by a single extended 
brunch . In addition, a continental breakfast is provided for early 
risers on the weekend  .
All students in Grades 8-10 must sign in and eat breakfast every 
morning  .
Snacks are provided at recess each weekday, after school and 
each evening (except Friday and Saturday) .
• There is always a salad bar, a vegetarian entrée and  
soup available  .
• Dress is casual for dinner, but it must follow the house 
guidelines  . Wearing pyjamas and other inappropriate 
garments to the dining hall is not allowed  .
• Food may not be taken out of Graves Hall  .
• For more information about dining options, please visit 
smus  .ca/campus-services/dining  .
The dining hall staff are committed to providing well-balanced, 
nourishing meals for our boarders and they welcome input from 
all students  . The kitchen conforms to the BC Food Guidelines 
for healthy eating in schools, and can accommodate allergies 
(e .g ., gluten or lactose intolerance) . Students should discuss their 
individual needs directly with the kitchen staff  .
A Food Committee is formed to represent boarders and we 
encourage students to get involved and communicate with 
their representatives regularly  .
Throughout the year, our community holds special theme nights 
and cultural meals in the dining hall  . Students can get involved 
by speaking with their Food Committee representative  .
In an effort to establish good eating habits, there are strict 
limitations regarding food deliveries to campus  . Boarders are 
expected to ask permission before having any food delivered  ."
43,"St. Michaels University SchoolFamily Handbook 2024-25  |  39Laundry
The school laundry facility is open Monday to Saturday and the 
hours are posted  . Boarding fees cover the use of the school 
laundry facility. Students will each have a laundry box where 
clean laundry will be placed  . For a minimal charge, the school 
will order name tags to be sewn into the student’s clothing for 
each boarding student . Students will be given two mesh bags in 
which to put small items for washing  .
Students should not expect a one-day turnaround, nor should 
they bring dirty laundry back to school if they have been home 
for a break  .
For sustainability and environmental reasons, the bulk of the 
laundry should be given to the laundry staff  . However, washing 
machines are also available for urgent use in each of the 
boarding houses and environmentally friendly soap is provided  . 
Dry cleaning services are offered twice per week with regular 
charges applied  . Any mending or hemming will be done by the 
laundry staff  . Some charges may apply  ."
