       "  'text': '   Breadcrumb VIDEO: Ontario University Tour By\\nKyle Slavin\\n-\\nNovember 18, 2022 Tags: Share: As our Grade 12 students look ahead to June and what path they will take after graduation, our University Counselling department is helping ensure students have as much information and as many experiences to make confident choices about their future. That\\'s why 29 students travelled to southern Ontario this past weekend to visit 11 universities and get a feel for the campuses, learn about the programs, see the facilities and connect with SMUS alumni who study there.(You can watch a video recap on the trip at the bottom of this story.) \"We\\'re all really glad this tour is back up and running again after COVID because we\\'ve seen year after year the value of a trip like this for our students,\" says Ruth McGhee, Director of University Counselling. \"Nothing compares to an in-person visit to know how far it is between buildings or how the food is or what the dorms look like. Those are important details. Our students can learn about programs and courses online, but this trip gives them a sense of what it\\'s like on the ground experiencing the reality of campus life.\" Traditionally, 15-20% of our graduating class any given year chooses to study at a university in southern Ontario. Getting to tour so many schools in eight different cities helps give students a more authentic feeling of what it would be like living and studying there. Historically, the Ontario trip has served as an invaluable tool for many – if not all – Grade 12 students who\\'ve participated either to reaffirm a chosen school, or to add a new school to (or remove one from) their list of schools they\\'ll apply to. The students met up with a number of young alumni studying in Ontario who say their experience on the trip was instrumental in making their post-secondary choices. \"I look at 2019 alumni like Jerry Wong, Tuan Anh Vu and Mylena Mendes who went on this trip and said it really helped crystalize for them what their path could look like and what their experience on that path would be,\" Ruth says. In addition to Jerry, Tuan and Mylena, SMUS alumni at most of the schools shared their firsthand experiences at each school. \"Chatting with alumni provides an extra layer of connection knowing that that student has also been at SMUS and now they\\'re at this particular university,\" Ruth says. \"It breaks down some of those barriers and allows them to lean into finding out what\\'s it like to study there. \\'Did SMUS prepare you well? How different is it from SMUS?\\' If our students can anchor it in really familiar experiences here and link it to their experiences there, they will be better equipped to choose a university.\" To see more from the Ontario tour,visit our Instagramandcheck out the \\'University Tour\\' highlights.

       "  'text': \"   Breadcrumb A Lifetime of Leadership By\\nGreg Gilks\\n-\\nJune 19, 2023 Tags: Share: This year, the Canadian Secondary Schools Rowing Association (CSSRA) recognized Susanne Walker Curry for her years of service to high school rowing by presenting her with a Lifetime Service Award. Susanne was honoured with the esteemed accolade during the 2023 CSSRA Championships held in St. Catharines, Ontario.Award recipients must have served high school rowing for at least 25 years. Susanne surpassed that mark through her 11 years at Brentwood College School and 17 years atSt. Michaels University School. Nevertheless, the essential prerequisite for Susanne was the need to have contributed to high school rowing by creating innovative, influential, and motivational initiatives. As Head of the SMUS rowing program, Susanne is known for her ability to develop well-rounded individuals and prepare them for the challenges of life in general, not just in sports. Just one of the highlights of Susanne’s commitment in recent years was the program she ran during COVID. When COVID first resulted in students being sent home, she implemented virtual fitness training sessions. Despite the time differences around the world, she had athletes from across Canada and the United States, England, Germany and Hong Kong who continued to participate as part of the team, despite some of them knowing they would never have the opportunity to row again for SMUS. Even when classes began but restrictions still applied for sports, Susanne moved the dryland training outdoors so athletes could continue their training while respecting the COVID restrictions. Firinne Rolfe ‘21 was offered multiple scholarship opportunities when she graduated. She credits Susanne with promoting healthy competitiveness and a love of hard work. She said Susanne always believed in her and pushed her to be the best version of herself. “She has always believed I could achieve things before I have had the confidence to believe it myself.”This sentiment was echoed by Nathan Yang ‘20 who noted “She believed in me even when I didn’t believe in myself.” He said that Susanne, through her critical yet compassionate approach to every athlete in the program, had an incredible impact on his life and development as a student, athlete and human being. Parents of athletes in the rowing program have observed the impact Susanne has had on their children. Dan Sheehan noted that Susanne’s “ability to transform kids from non-athletes to Canadian champions is truly miraculous. It is through her inspirational teaching methods and her true love for each and every member of her team and fellow coaches that she is able to create transformative change.” The life lessons learned from Susanne will carry these young people long into the future. Martin McElroy, who was not only a parent but also an Olympic Gold medal rowing coach, understands the demands and stress of the job. According to Martin, being a professional coach was relatively easy when compared with running a program in a school environment, balancing the demands of school, academic and sporting life, and maintaining a position as a teacher. Martin said he helped with coaching whenever he was able, but he felt the SMUS rowing program may have helped him more than he helped the program. “Watching young athletes have fun, seeing them develop as individuals, and see them come together selflessly for the team was a reaffirmation of the power of sport to me. There is no question that the hub and source of the energy that propels the SMUS rowing program comes from Susanne.” Sarah Hagkull ‘16, current SMUS rowing Assistant Coach, credits Susanne’s empowering mindset and leadership with bringing her to the position and profile she currently has at the school, and in life in general. She reflected on how she learned that whether sitting at the starting line, crossing the finish line or walking through the hotel lobby, she represented the school, team, families, and coaches, as well as herself. Susanne’s passion for the rowing program and her athletes is evident in both the program and her rowers. She has not hesitated to bring in other professionals to support the athlete development, including a former athlete who now has a career in Los Angeles, to host an online scavenger hunt on campus for team members. The athletes were having so much fun they didn’t recognize the teambuilding and fitness aspect of the activities until the event was finished. Susanne also engaged a sport psychology professional to support the athlete's development. In these cases, the individuals donated their talents and time out of respect for Susanne. That respect and passion is evident even at the local regattas where SMUS rowing alumni returning from university regularly volunteer their services to help at major regattas and encourage current team members. Nathan Yang ‘20 summed it up best when he said “She is much more than just a rowing coach; she is a teacher, leader, mentor, and most of all – family. One team, one family.” Tags: Greg Gilks  You might also be interested in Athletics Athletics NEWS - September 23, 2024 Athletics Week in Review: September 23, 2024 Athletics Athletics NEWS - September 19, 2024 SMUS Senior Boys Volleyball: Team Gears Up for Intense Season with Playoff Ambitions Athletics Athletics NEWS - September 18, 2024 SMUS Senior Boys Soccer: Optimism and Experience Fuel Promising Season St. Michaels University School is an independent day and boarding school of 1,000 students from Junior Kindergarten to Grade 12 in Victoria, BC, Canada.

Read the 2019 Retiree series to learn more about their outstanding contributions to the school. In this story, we recognize Janice Iverson, former Senior School receptionist. Janice Iverson Anyone who entered School House at the Senior School campus can likely attest to the warm welcome they received from Janice Iverson. In 1999, Janice came on board at St. Michaels University School for part-time reception. During the first years, she also explored a few other areas including admissions and university counselling before settling into her role at reception. Sincere and warm, Janice set the tone and managed the needs of each person who entered the school. Before SMUS, Janice had worked in secretarial and administrative work, but she had never worked in education. What struck her was the “energy, variety and family-focus” of the SMUS environment. Drawn to the “community-based, flexible nature” of the school, Janice dedicated her time and energy here for the next 20 years. “I really enjoyed going to work. It was never dull or tedious,” she says. “I do miss it. It was great. I do hope to drop in for visits from time to time.” Some of the most profound changes during Janice’s time with the school were dramatic physical developments with the Crothall Centre for Arts and Humanities (2002), the John and Anne Schaffter Hall Music Centre (2004), the Monkman Athletic Complex (2008), the Sun Centre student commons and dining hall (2018). Witnessing and supporting the growth, both in structure and student capacity, of SMUS was significant for Janice. “The Sun Centre was a really big one for the students. It’s so beautiful.” “There are so many programs and SMUS goes beyond normal learning,” Janice shares. “There were also so many opportunities to contribute and do things. It was wonderful to have the chance to get to know other staff and faculty informally.” She loved pitching in with the Spring Fairs, Alumni Weekend and the International Markets. Of note was participating in the SMUS corporate rowing challenge and winning first place with her team, Ducks in a Row in 2016. Janice retired in 2018 but filled in on reception for several weeks during the summer of 2019. Moving forward, Janice will continue to paint abstracts in acrylic, hike and travel (upcoming trips include England, Scotland and Hawaii). Her Hawaii trip next year is with her 95-year-old mother, her agile, very bright “role model.” She also plans to “duck” into the school for a coffee now and again to maintain connection with her friends and the SMUS community.

       "'Susanne says there is no way this could happen without the generosity and kindness of our donors and supporters. This year the rowing program hopes to purchase a “heavy four”, with the cost of this boat being $30,000. As well, a new trailer is needed at a cost of $40,000. We hope to raise this $70,000 in our annual appeal in support of the SMUS Rowing program. The deadline to give is June 30. You can donate online atwww.smus.ca/givingor contact me atshara.campsall@smus.caor\\xa0250-370-6197. “Thank you,” from our rowers!We asked four students currently competing at the CSSRA Regatta (national competition) to explain what the rowing program means to them. Hannah Look (Victoria; Grade 9) says the rowing program gives her a “sense of home” at the school and has instilled a confidence that she carries into life outside of rowing. The busy training schedule has taught her to manage her time wisely.'"
